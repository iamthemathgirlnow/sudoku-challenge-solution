We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.

# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so when it is your turn I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format (replace content with actual game):
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,_,4,5,6,7]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]
eighth_row: [6,7,8,9,1,2,3,_,5]
ninth_row: [9,1,2,_,4,5,_,7,8]

# Missing elements analysis
Now I want you to print out all twenty-seven sets to check. That's the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine 3-by-3 blocks. This is to find the candidates that are Not in each row, column, or 3-by-3 block.
At this stage DO NOT attempt to fill in any elements. All _ elements MUST remain as _ elements. This is VITAL.
## Row elements
Remember, the rows are just the rows as above.
As an example, the board state above would have the Correct element analysis:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9] there are two missing elements: [8,7] (remember, the digits do not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there)
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3] there are no missing elements: []
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6] there is one missing element: [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1] there is one missing element: [9]
...
and do this for all nine rows

## Column elements
Remember, the columns are One element from Each row, from the same Position in each row. So the fourth_column is the fourth element from Every row, or the left element of the middle block of Every row.
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] there are no missing elements: [] (remember, these are the first elements of Each row)
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] there are no missing elements: []
third_column: [3,6,_,4,7,1,5,8,2] there is one missing element: [9]
fourth_column: [4,7,1,5,8,2,6,9,_] there is one missing element: [3]
...
and do this for all nine columns

## Block elements
Remember: the elements in the blocks are made from three elements each from Three Different Rows, NOT just from a single row. So the top_left_block in this example would be [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, _]], with [1,2,3] from the first_row left-three-columns, [4,5,6] from the second_row left-three-columns, and [7,8,_] from the third_row left-three-columns.
We add an extra count of the underscores in each block since this part is tricky. The underscore count will give you the EXACT number of missing candidates for each block.
Also, the missing elements given in each row and column above May Not be in order, so be Very careful to get the right elements if using them.
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, _]]
there is one underscore here
so there is one missing element: [9] (remember, these are from the first, second, AND third rows)

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, 9],
[1, 2, 3]]
there are no underscores here
so there are no missing elements: []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[_, _, 9],
[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6]]
there are two underscores here
so there are two missing elements: [7,8]

middle_left_block (rows: fourth, fifth, sixth; columns: first, second, third):
[[2, 3, 4],
[5, 6, 7],
[8, 9, 1]]
there are no underscores here
so there are no missing elements: []
...
and do this for all nine blocks

AFTER you have done that, go through each row and list JUST the column position of each unfilled/underscore element (if any) in each row.

THEN, go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block, containing that cell (make sure to get the blocks right).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a cell, list out the Common elements (if any) which appear in All Three missing element sets of that cell.
For example:
Cell 7 (Row 1, Column 7):
- Row Missing Elements: [7,8]
- Column Missing Elements: [6,7]
- Block Missing Elements: [7,8]
  Common Elements: [7]

Cell 8 (Row 1, Column 8):
- Row Missing Elements: [7,8]
- Column Missing Elements: [8,4,9]
- Block Missing Elements: [7,8]
  Common Elements: [8]
...
and do this for all unfilled cells

Use the example given as the sudoku we are analyzing.
We are only doing one 'pass through' each time, so please follow the exact format as given and DO NOT add anything else.
