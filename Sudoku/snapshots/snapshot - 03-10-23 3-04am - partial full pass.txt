We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.

# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format (replace content with actual game):
## Rows
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,_,4,5,6,7]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]
eighth_row: [6,7,8,9,1,2,3,_,5]
ninth_row: [9,1,2,_,4,5,_,7,8]

## Columns
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1]
third_column: [3,6,_,4,7,1,5,8,2]
fourth_column: [4,7,1,5,8,2,6,9,_]
fifth_column: [5,8,2,6,9,_,7,1,4]
sixth_column: [6,9,3,7,1,4,8,2,5]
seventh_column: [_,1,4,8,2,5,9,3,_]
eighth_column: [_,2,5,_,3,6,1,_,7]
ninth_column: [9,3,6,1,4,7,2,5,8]

# Missing elements analysis
Now I want you to print out all twenty-seven sets to check. That's the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine 3-by-3 blocks. This is to find the candidates that are Not in each row, column, or 3-by-3 block.
At this stage DO NOT attempt to fill in any elements. All _ elements MUST remain as _ elements. This is VITAL.
## Row elements
Remember, the rows are just the rows as above.
As an example, the board state above would have the Correct element analysis:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9] missing elements: [8,7] (remember, the digits do not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there)
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3] missing elements: []
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6] missing elements: [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1] missing elements: [9]
...
and do this for All Nine rows

## Column elements
Remember, the columns are an element from the same position in Each row. So the fourth_column is the fourth element from Every row, ect.
Make sure to get All Elements INCLUDING UNDERSCORES in each column Exactly as they appear in the current game.
Make sure NOT to replace a '_' with a number Even If You Know What It Should Be. This is VITAL.
Remember, the digits Do Not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there. So if you write '[4]' and realize you also needed to add a '5', just write ', actually [4,5]' immediately after it.
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] missing elements: [] (remember, these are the first elements of each row)
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] missing elements: []
third_column: [3,6,_,4,7,1,5,8,2] missing elements: [9]
fourth_column: [4,7,1,5,8,2,6,9,_] missing elements: [3]
...
and do this for All Nine columns

## Block elements
Remember: the elements in the blocks are made from three elements each from Three Different Rows, NOT just from a single row. So the top_left_block in this example would be [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, _]], with [1,2,3] from the first_row left-three-columns, [4,5,6] from the second_row left-three-columns, and [7,8,_] from the third_row left-three-columns.
Each block and its missing elements should (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates and each number appearing exactly once.
Also, the missing elements given in each row and column above May Not be in order, so be Very careful to get the right elements if using them.
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, _]]
missing element: [9] (remember, these are from the first, second, AND third rows)

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, 9],
[1, 2, 3]]
missing elements: []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[_, _, 9],
[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6]]
missing elements: [7,8]

middle_left_block (rows: fourth, fifth, sixth; columns: first, second, third):
[[2, 3, 4],
[5, 6, 7],
[8, 9, 1]]
missing elements: []
...
and do this for All Nine blocks

# Candidate analysis
First section done, take a deep breath.
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
Now that we have the missing elements, we need to find the unfilled squares.
Go through each row and list JUST the column position of each unfilled/underscore element (if any) in each row.
first_row: seventh eighth columns
third_row: third column
fourth_row: eighth column
sixth_row: fifth column
eighth_row: eight column
ninth_row: fourth seventh columns

## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (make sure to get the blocks right!).
Use the 'Block elements' section above to figure out the Correct block from the row And the column (BOTH have to match). Specifically use the lines "top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):" at the start of each block.
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the Common elements (if any) which appear in All Three missing element sets of that square.
For example:
### first_row, 1 of 6!
square (1,7) (first_row, seventh_column):
first_row missing elements: [7,8]
seventh_column missing elements: [6,7]
top_right_block missing elements: [7,8]
Common elements: [7]

square (1,8) (first_row, eighth_column):
first_row missing elements: [7,8]
eighth_column missing elements: [8,4,9]
top_right_block missing elements: [7,8]
Common elements: [8]
...
and do this for All unfilled squares

We are currently in the testing phase. Do All sections exactly as instructed above, and then stop.
Make sure to do Every section In Full, starting with printing the board state and ending only After All squares and their common candidates have been listed.

We are analyzing the following sudoku. Make sure to convert it to the Correct format when printing the board state.
