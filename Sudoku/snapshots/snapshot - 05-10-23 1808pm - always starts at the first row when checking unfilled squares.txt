You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: 


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1]) = [9]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = []
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block_missing_elements]) = [9]

Examples:
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1,2,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_left_block) = [9]

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_middle_block) = []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_right_block) = [7,8]

middle_left_block (rows: fourth, fifth, sixth; columns: first, second, third):



# Finding the positions of unfilled squares
## Listing the position of unfilled squares
Before we use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 8

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(adjusted_total_unfilled_squares, 20) = 8



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the 'Listing the position of unfilled squares' section.
For each unfilled square we examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND (column_missing_elements)]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements (elements in both STEP_A AND (block_missing_elements))

Use the following format:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight
#### 1 of 20 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, seventh_column_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure Not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_C". If it was just TURN_C, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: {the next turn}

first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]
eighth_row: [6,7,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]
ninth_row: [9,1,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]
</output>
