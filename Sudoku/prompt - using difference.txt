We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present in each set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, find the elements Not in Any of the three sets, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.

# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format (replace content with actual game).
You Must print out the board state in terms of Rows, Columns, and Blocks.
## Rows
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,_,4,5,6,7]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]
eighth_row: [6,7,8,9,1,2,3,_,5]
ninth_row: [9,1,2,_,4,5,_,7,8]

## Columns
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1]
third_column: [3,6,_,4,7,1,5,8,2]
fourth_column: [4,7,1,5,8,2,6,9,_]
fifth_column: [5,8,2,6,9,_,7,1,4]
sixth_column: [6,9,3,7,1,4,8,2,5]
seventh_column: [_,1,4,8,2,5,9,3,_]
eighth_column: [_,2,5,_,3,6,1,_,7]
ninth_column: [9,3,6,1,4,7,2,5,8]

## Blocks
Remember: the elements in the blocks are made from three elements each from Three Different Rows, NOT just from a single row. So the top_left_block in this example would be [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, _]], with [1,2,3] from the first_row left-three-columns, [4,5,6] from the second_row left-three-columns, and [7,8,_] from the third_row left-three-columns.
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1, 2, 3], (remember, these are from the first, second, AND third rows)
[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, _]]
top_left_block.flattened = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_]

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, 9],
[1, 2, 3]]
top_middle_block.flattened = [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[_, _, 9],
[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6]]
top_right_block.flattened = [_,_,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]

middle_left_block (rows: fourth, fifth, sixth; columns: first, second, third):
[[2, 3, 4],
[5, 6, 7],
[8, 9, 1]]
middle_left_block.flattened = [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1]
...
and do this for All Nine blocks

# Candidate analysis
First section done, take a deep breath.
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
Now that we have the missing elements, we need to find the unfilled squares.
Go through each row and list JUST the column position of each unfilled/underscore element (if any) in each row.
first_row: seventh eighth columns
third_row: third column
fourth_row: eighth column
sixth_row: fifth column
eighth_row: eight column
ninth_row: fourth seventh columns

## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block). Make Sure to use the flattened version of the block for a consistent format.
After you have listed the three element sets for a square, list out the difference of those sets, the elements from 1-9 that are in NONE of the three listed sets. We do this in three steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.
For each square Make Sure to use the sets you have JUST WRITTEN DOWN!!! They are the closest and easiest to see, giving you the LEAST mistakes. That's why we wrote them down Right There!
There are 6 rows with unfilled squares:
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
### first_row, 1 of 6! (replace 6 with the number of rows with unfilled squares)
(first_row, seventh_column):
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9]
seventh_column: [_,1,4,8,2,5,9,3,_]
top_right_block.flattened: [_,_,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]
STEP_A = all_digits.difference(first_row) = [7,8]
STEP_B = STEP_A.difference(seventh_column) = [7]
STEP_C = STEP_B.difference(top_right_block.flattened) = [7]
first_row_seventh_column_candidate_elements = STEP_C: [7]

(first_row, eighth_column):
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9]
eighth_column: [_,2,5,_,3,6,1,_,7]
top_right_block.flattened: [_,_,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]
STEP_A = all_digits.difference(first_row) = [7,8]
STEP_B = STEP_A.difference(eighth_column) = [8]
STEP_C = STEP_B.difference(top_right_block.flattened) = [8]
first_row_eighth_column_candidate_elements = STEP_C: [8]
...
and do this for All unfilled squares

We are currently in the testing phase. Do All sections exactly as instructed above, and then stop.
Make sure to do Every section In Full, starting with printing the board states and ending only After All squares and their common candidates have been listed.
EXCEPT, for testing purposes only do the FIRST THREE unfilled squares, but make sure to do ALL of the first three unfilled squares. THEN you can stop.
Please do not use code blocks, just plain text with simple headers as in the instructions is fine.

We are analyzing the following sudoku. Make sure to convert it to the Correct format when printing the board states.
