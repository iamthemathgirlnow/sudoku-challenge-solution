top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):

Make sure to do Every section in full, starting with printing the board state.
# Board State
header in general

Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
(No idea why, but saying 'cell' instead of 'square' broke the columns Every time)

Please do not use code blocks, just plain text with simple headers as in the instructions is fine.
(When testing with ChatGPT on the browser, code blocks break it)
(We can try the API without this line)

I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format (replace content with actual game):
(saying 'puzzle' here instead of 'game' made it stop the blocks after the examples)
(this happened twice in a row, even with a tweak to make it more likely to continue)
(and it Did continue the second time, but only after printing '(continued below...)/n(continued...)')
(so we went back to 'game' here and it worked without a problem)
