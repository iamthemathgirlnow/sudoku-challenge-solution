# Task
- We want to thoroughly check the output of the previous analysis, catching any errors making sure that don't go through to the next part of the process.
- To do this we are going to do some long form calculations. It is necessary to do All calculations in FULL, as this is the only way to be SURE we catch all errors.


# STEP_ONE Output Analysis Results
- The previous results were calculated with lots of extra working out, then a set length of the results was displayed as your previous message.
- Your previous response should include the section 'Output Analysis Results' but may also include some of the previous working out, which we do not need.
- To start, we want to extract _just_ the results of the 'Output Analysis Results' section of your previous message. That's all the text in the section, and none of the text before that section.
- Reprint _just_ the text in the previous Output Analysis Results section. Use 'STEP_ONE Output Analysis Results' for the header.
- EXCEPT we are making one change to the text. We want to replace '_missing_elements' with '_candidates'. That is the only change, everything else should be the same.


# STEP_TWO Checking the length of common_candidates
- Using the results in STEP_ONE, we want to check that for each square there is only one common element in common_candidates
- For each square in step one, perform the following:
    - Print just the first line without the trailing 'Which has only one element' text. This should be just 'square' to '[elements]'
    - Now print _just_ the common_candidates list
    - Now perform the calculation [elements].length = number from 0 to 9
    - Now either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.

This should look like:
square(row, column) common_candidates: [elements]
[elements]
[elements].length = number from 0 to 9
length is 1, Passes
(or)
length is {length}, not 1, Rejected

- Do this for each square from STEP_ONE

## Squares with one given candidate
- Now list all the passing squares from STEP_TWO, making sure Not to list any of the rejected squares.
- Use the following format for each.
square(row, column) candidate: [element]
row_candidates = [row_candidates]
column_candidates = [column_candidates]
block_candidates = [block_candidates]


# STEP_THREE 
- Now we need to check that no common_candidates were mistakenly missed when the common_candidates were originally produced.
- We are going to do this rigorously.
- Use the squares from 'Squares with one given candidate' from STEP_TWO
- For each square do the following:
    - Go through the digits 1 to 9 in order, covering all 9 digits
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates, in the column_candidates, and in the block_candidates lists. We do these separately, so the count for each should be either 0 or 1.
    - Then sum the counts together to get a total count, which is the number of times that digit appears in all three sets.
    - If the total digit count is not 3 (likely either 0, 1, or 2), then we add 'which is not 3' to the end of the calculation.
    - If the total digit count is 3, then that digit is a candidate for that square and we add ' which IS 3, FOUND(digit)' to the end of the calculation.
    - After doing this for all 9 digits, we collate the FOUND common digits into one place, then move on to the next square.

For each square, print the header "## Square 1 of {number of squares}" (iterating by one for each square until)
- Example of the first line of each square (after the header):
square(first_row, second_column): first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6], second_column_candidates = [5,6,7,8,9], top_left_block_candidates = [1,3,4,6,7]
- Example of a digit calculation which does not sum to 3:
first_row_candidates.count(1) = 1, second_column_candidates.count(1) = 0, top_left_block_candidates.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 which is not 3
- Example of a digit calculation which does sum to 3:
first_row_candidates.count(6) = 1, second_column_candidates.count(6) = 1, top_left_block_candidates.count(6) = 1, total_count(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 which IS 3, FOUND(6)
- Example of the final line of each square:
Confirmed common elements found for square(first_row, second_column): [6]

- You must perform all digit calculations in full for every square. These candidates were _produced_ using quick calculations, which are prone to errors. The only way to catch the errors is to Actully Do the long form.


# Final notes
We are still in the testing phase, so just do the given tasks and then stop without adding anything else.
You must do All calculations in All sections.
Print all output using the appropriate headers.
Please do not use code blocks, just plain text with simple headers as in the instructions is fine.




- The previous results were generated by first finding the candidates of the given row, column, and block.
- That is, if a given row was only missing a 3 and a 5, then row_candidates would be [3,5]

- What are we doing in this bit?
- Checking something? Yes.
- Checking for each square:
    - That there is only one common element in common_candidates
    - That no numbers were missed, and common_candidates should actually have more than one element
    - The number in common_candidates is in row_candidates, column_candidates, and block_candidates






Working for STEP_THREE:
- What approach are we taking? This one's the crux if this whole part (verifying the candidates before updating them)
- Options first? Or... Task, task first
- So! What is the task?
    - We have three lists of elements (integers from 1 to 9)
    - We want to check if there are any elements common to all three lists OTHER than the candidate element
    - We also want to check (here or elsewhere) that the candidate element is indeed in all three lists
    - The lists were produced using error prone methods such as .intersection (by an LLM, not a CPU), so we want something more... robust
    - How would _we_ do it ourselves? As in, on paper?
    - Well... Grab some paper and see!

Method 1:
square(first_row, fourth_column): first_row_candidates = [1,2,5,6,7], fourth_column_candidates = [1,2,3,4,5,8,9], top_middle_block_candidates = [3,5,6]
first_row_candidates.count(1) = 1, fourth_column_candidates.count(1) = 1, top_middle_block_candidates.count(1) = 0, total_count(1) = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 which is not 3
first_row_candidates.count(5) = 1, fourth_column_candidates.count(5) = 1, top_middle_block_candidates.count(5) = 1, total_count(5) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 which IS 3, FOUND(5)
Confirmed common elements found for square(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
(total tokens including all 9 lines, 586 per square)

- Use the following format for each digit calculation:
row_candidates.count(digit) = digit_count_row, column_candidates.count(digit) = digit_count_column, block_candidates.count(digit) = digit_count_block, total_count(digit) = digit_count_row, digit_count_column, digit_count_block = digit_count_total (plus added message)

- Here is a partial example
square(row, column): row_candidates = [1,2,5,6,7], column_candidates = [1,2,3,4,5,8,9], block_candidates = [3,5,6]
row_candidates.count(1) = num_row, column_candidates.count(1) = num_column, block_candidates.count(1) = num_block, total_count(1) = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 which is not 3
row_candidates.count(5) = 1, column_candidates.count(5) = 1, block_candidates.count(5) = 1, total_count(5) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 which IS 3, FOUND(5)
Confirmed common elements found for square(first_row, fourth_column): [5]


Method 2: (a reduction of method 1)
square(first_row, fourth_column): row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,5,6,7], column = fourth_column_candidates = [1,2,3,4,5,8,9], block = top_middle_block_candidates = [3,5,6]
first_row_candidates.count(1) = 1, fourth_column_candidates.count(1) = 1, top_middle_block_candidates.count(1) = 0, total_count(1) = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 which is not 3
first_row_candidates.count(5) = 1, fourth_column_candidates.count(5) = 1, top_middle_block_candidates.count(5) = 1, total_count(5) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 which IS 3, FOUND(5)
Confirmed common elements found for square(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
