# Task and background
- The previous response contains the last few hundred characters of a sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore everything before that.
- The squares given in the section "Unbiased Results" are squares which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given squares will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many squares at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given squares.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each square using the method given below.
    - If a square has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that square as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous response.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every square. Everything else should remain the same.
- These squares will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each square
- For each square from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that square.
- For each square:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each square, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that square.
- Everytime you complete a square print "Square {current square number} of {number of squares} complete! {number of squares left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next square until all are done.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Square 1 of {number of squares}
square(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for square(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Square 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the squares, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the squares
square(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
square(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
square(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the squares



# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each square
- For each square, count the number of elements in the candidates of that square using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
square(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the squares, list the squares which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected squares.
- Example:
## Passing Squares
square(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
square(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Stop after completing STEP_THREE


# Final notes
- We are still in the testing phase and all tasks may not be present. Complete all Given tasks and then stop without adding anything else.
- Make sure to finish All tasks in STEP_ONE, STEP_TWO, and STEP_THREE, and only THEN stop.
- Print all output using the appropriate headers.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine..
