We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace content with actual game).
We are also finding the missing elements of that set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9] first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(first_row) = [7,8]

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares.
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = total_unfilled_squares

Then we cap the number of squares to list
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 20) = 20


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

If we are on TURN_A, go through the squares in normal order.
HOWEVER, if we are on TURN_B, go through the squares in REVERSE order, starting with the LAST unfilled square and going BACKWARDS. Make sure to still list number_of_squares_to_list squares and then stop.
Print either "We are on TURN_A and go forwards through the squares." OR "We are on TURN_B and go backwards though the squares."

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 20 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

If we are in TURN_B, after listing the squares with one common_missing_element, list them AGAIN in NORMAL order (top_left to bottom_right). This makes the final output easier to write.
Give this list (and ONLY) this list the heading ("Correct Order")

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: TURN_A

first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0,9]
