## Common candidates: 107*limit
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element: 10*limit

Total per square: 107 or 117, (or 117*limit max)
Usual Varying Total: 107*limit + 3*10 = 107* limit + 30

The prompt at current (almost) can handle 21 squares at a time.
That's not too far of the 25 to 26 we figured as strongly viable.

TIME TO REFINE!!!


Using
    107*limit + 3*10 = 107* limit + 30
    limit = 20
Gives us
Max Varying Total: 2170
