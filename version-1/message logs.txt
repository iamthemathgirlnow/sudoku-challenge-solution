We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.

# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so when it is your turn I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format (replace content with actual game):
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,_,4,5,6,7]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]
eighth_row: [6,7,8,9,1,2,3,_,5]
ninth_row: [9,1,2,_,4,5,_,7,8]

# Row elements
THEN, I want you to print out all twenty-seven sets to check. That's the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine 3-by-3 blocks. This is to find the candidates that are Not in each row, column, or 3-by-3 block.
At this stage DO NOT attempt to fill in any elements. All _ elements MUST remain as _ elements. This is VITAL.
Remember, the rows are just the rows as above.
As an example, the board state above would have the Correct element analysis:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9] there are two missing elements: [8,7] (the there is one missing element: digits Do Not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there)
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3] there are no missing elements: []
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6] there is one missing element: [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1] there is one missing element: [9]
...
and do this for all nine rows

# Column elements
Remember, the columns are One element from Each row, from the same Position in each row. So the fourth_column is the fourth element from Every row, or the left element of the middle block of Every row.
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] there are no missing elements: [] (remember, these are the first elements of Each row)
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] there are no missing elements: []
third_column: [3,6,_,4,7,1,5,8,2] there is one missing element: [9]
fourth_column: [4,7,1,5,8,2,6,9,_] there is one missing element: [3]
...
and do this for all nine columns

# Block elements
Remember: the elements in the blocks are made from three elements each from Three Different Rows, NOT just from a single row. So the top_left_block in this example would be [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, _]], with [1,2,3] from the first_row left-three-columns, [4,5,6] from the second_row left-three-columns, and [7,8,_] from the third_row left-three-columns.
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, _]]
there is one missing element: [9] (remember, these are from the first, second, AND third rows)

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, 9],
[1, 2, 3]]
there are no missing elements: []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[_, _, 9],
[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6]]
there are two missing elements: [7,8]

middle_left_block (rows: fourth, fifth, sixth; columns: first, second, third):
[[2, 3, 4],
[5, 6, 7],
[8, 9, 1]]
there are no missing elements: []
...
and do this for all nine blocks

We are currently in the testing phase. Do all twenty-seven elements sets as above and then stop. But please do ALL twenty-seven element sets.
Use the example given as the sudoku we are analyzing.
Make sure to do Every section in full, starting with printing the board state.

We add an extra count of the underscores in each block since this part is tricky. The underscore count will give you the EXACT number of missing candidates for each block.
Also, the missing elements given in each row and column above May Not be in order, so be Very careful to get the right elements if using them.
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):

# Candidate analysis
First section done, take a deep breath.
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
Now that we have the missing elements, we need to find the unfilled squares.
Go through each row and list JUST the column position of each unfilled/underscore element (if any) in each row.

We are currently in the testing phase. Do all sections exactly as instructed above, and then stop.
Use the example given as the sudoku we are analyzing.
Make sure to do Every section in full, starting with printing the board state.

We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.

# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format (replace content with actual game):
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,_,4,5,6,7]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]
eighth_row: [6,7,8,9,1,2,3,_,5]
ninth_row: [9,1,2,_,4,5,_,7,8]

# Missing elements analysis
Now I want you to print out all twenty-seven sets to check. That's the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine 3-by-3 blocks. This is to find the candidates that are Not in each row, column, or 3-by-3 block.
At this stage DO NOT attempt to fill in any elements. All _ elements MUST remain as _ elements. This is VITAL.
## Row elements
Remember, the rows are just the rows as above.
As an example, the board state above would have the Correct element analysis:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9] there are two missing elements: [8,7] (remember, the digits do not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there)
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3] there are no missing elements: []
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6] there is one missing element: [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1] there is one missing element: [9]
...
and do this for All Nine rows

## Column elements
Remember, the columns are One element from Each row, from the same Position in each row. So the fourth_column is the fourth element from Every row, or the left element of the middle block of Every row.
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] there are no missing elements: [] (remember, these are the first elements of Each row)
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] there are no missing elements: []
third_column: [3,6,_,4,7,1,5,8,2] there is one missing element: [9]
fourth_column: [4,7,1,5,8,2,6,9,_] there is one missing element: [3]
...
and do this for All Nine columns

## Block elements
Remember: the elements in the blocks are made from three elements each from Three Different Rows, NOT just from a single row. So the top_left_block in this example would be [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, _]], with [1,2,3] from the first_row left-three-columns, [4,5,6] from the second_row left-three-columns, and [7,8,_] from the third_row left-three-columns.
We add an extra count of the underscores in each block since this part is tricky. The underscore count will give you the EXACT number of missing candidates for each block.
Also, the missing elements given in each row and column above May Not be in order, so be Very careful to get the right elements if using them.
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, _]]
there is one underscore here
so there is one missing element: [9] (remember, these are from the first, second, AND third rows)

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, 9],
[1, 2, 3]]
there are no underscores here
so there are no missing elements: []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[_, _, 9],
[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6]]
there are two underscores here
so there are two missing elements: [7,8]

middle_left_block (rows: fourth, fifth, sixth; columns: first, second, third):
[[2, 3, 4],
[5, 6, 7],
[8, 9, 1]]
there are no underscores here
so there are no missing elements: []
...
and do this for All Nine blocks

# Candidate analysis
First section done, take a deep breath.
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
Now that we have the missing elements, we need to find the unfilled squares.
Go through each row and list JUST the column position of each unfilled/underscore element (if any) in each row.

## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (make sure to get the blocks right!).
Use the 'Block elements' section above to figure out the Correct block from the row And the column (BOTH have to match). Specifically use the lines "top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):" at the start of each block.
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the Common elements (if any) which appear in All Three missing element sets of that square.
For example:
square (1,7) (first_row, seventh_column):
first_row missing elements: [7,8]
seventh_column missing elements: [6,7]
top_right_block missing elements: [7,8]
Common elements: [7]

square (1,8) (first_row, eighth_column):
first_row missing elements: [7,8]
eighth_column missing elements: [8,4,9]
top_right_block missing elements: [7,8]
Common elements: [8]
...
and do this for All unfilled squares

Make sure NOT to replace a '_' with a number Even If You Know What It Should Be. This is VITAL.
Remember, the digits Do Not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there. So if you write '[4]' and realize you also needed to add 5, just write ', actually [4,5]' immediately after it.

We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.

# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format (replace content with actual game):
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,_,4,5,6,7]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]
eighth_row: [6,7,8,9,1,2,3,_,5]
ninth_row: [9,1,2,_,4,5,_,7,8]

# Missing elements analysis
Now I want you to print out all twenty-seven sets to check. That's the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine 3-by-3 blocks. This is to find the candidates that are Not in each row, column, or 3-by-3 block.
At this stage DO NOT attempt to fill in any elements. All _ elements MUST remain as _ elements. This is VITAL.
## Row elements
Remember, the rows are just the rows as above.
As an example, the board state above would have the Correct element analysis:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9] there are two missing elements: [8,7] (remember, the digits do not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there)
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3] there are no missing elements: []
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6] there is one missing element: [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1] there is one missing element: [9]
...
and do this for All Nine rows

## Column elements
Remember, the columns are One element from Each row, from the same Position in each row. So the fourth_column is the fourth element from Every row, or the left element of the middle block of Every row.
Make sure to get All Elements INCLUDING UNDERSCORES in each column Exactly as they appear in the current game.
Make sure NOT to replace a '_' with a number Even If You Know What It Should Be. This is VITAL.
Remember, the digits Do Not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there. So if you write '[4]' and realize you also needed to add 5, just write ', actually [4,5]' immediately after it.
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] there are no missing elements: []
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] there are no missing elements: [] (remember, these are the second elements of each row)
third_column: [3,6,_,4,7,1,5,8,2] there is one missing element: [9]
fourth_column: [4,7,1,5,8,2,6,9,_] there is one missing element: [3]
...
and do this for All Nine columns

## Block elements
Remember: the elements in the blocks are made from three elements each from Three Different Rows, NOT just from a single row. So the top_left_block in this example would be [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, _]], with [1,2,3] from the first_row left-three-columns, [4,5,6] from the second_row left-three-columns, and [7,8,_] from the third_row left-three-columns.
We add an extra count of the underscores in each block since this part is tricky. The underscore count will give you the EXACT number of missing candidates for each block.
Also, the missing elements given in each row and column above May Not be in order, so be Very careful to get the right elements if using them.
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, _]]
there is one underscore here
so there is one missing element: [9] (remember, these are from the first, second, AND third rows)

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, 9],
[1, 2, 3]]
there are no underscores here
so there are no missing elements: []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[_, _, 9],
[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6]]
there are two underscores here
so there are two missing elements: [7,8]

middle_left_block (rows: fourth, fifth, sixth; columns: first, second, third):
[[2, 3, 4],
[5, 6, 7],
[8, 9, 1]]
there are no underscores here
so there are no missing elements: []
...
and do this for All Nine blocks

# Candidate analysis
First section done, take a deep breath.
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
Now that we have the missing elements, we need to find the unfilled squares.
Go through each row and list JUST the column position of each unfilled/underscore element (if any) in each row.

## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (make sure to get the blocks right!).
Use the 'Block elements' section above to figure out the Correct block from the row And the column (BOTH have to match). Specifically use the lines "top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):" at the start of each block.
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the Common elements (if any) which appear in All Three missing element sets of that square.
For example:
square (1,7) (first_row, seventh_column):
first_row missing elements: [7,8]
seventh_column missing elements: [6,7]
top_right_block missing elements: [7,8]
Common elements: [7]

square (1,8) (first_row, eighth_column):
first_row missing elements: [7,8]
eighth_column missing elements: [8,4,9]
top_right_block missing elements: [7,8]
Common elements: [8]
...
and do this for All unfilled squares

We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.

# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format (replace content with actual game):
## Rows
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,_,4,5,6,7]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]
eighth_row: [6,7,8,9,1,2,3,_,5]
ninth_row: [9,1,2,_,4,5,_,7,8]

## Columns
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1]
third_column: [3,6,_,4,7,1,5,8,2]
fourth_column: [4,7,1,5,8,2,6,9,_]
fifth_column: [5,8,2,6,9,_,7,1,4]
sixth_column: [6,9,3,7,1,4,8,2,5]
seventh_column: [_,1,4,8,2,5,9,3,_]
eighth_column: [_,2,5,_,3,6,1,_,7]
ninth_column: [9,3,6,1,4,7,2,5,8]

# Missing elements analysis
Now I want you to print out all twenty-seven sets to check. That's the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine 3-by-3 blocks. This is to find the candidates that are Not in each row, column, or 3-by-3 block.
At this stage DO NOT attempt to fill in any elements. All _ elements MUST remain as _ elements. This is VITAL.
## Row elements
Remember, the rows are just the rows as above.
As an example, the board state above would have the Correct element analysis:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9] there are two missing elements: [8,7] (remember, the digits do not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there)
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3] there are no missing elements: []
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6] there is one missing element: [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1] there is one missing element: [9]
...
and do this for All Nine rows

## Column elements
Remember, the columns are an element from the same position in Each row. So the fourth_column is the fourth element from Every row, ect.
Make sure to get All Elements INCLUDING UNDERSCORES in each column Exactly as they appear in the current game.
Make sure NOT to replace a '_' with a number Even If You Know What It Should Be. This is VITAL.
Remember, the digits Do Not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there. So if you write '[4]' and realize you also needed to add 5, just write ', actually [4,5]' immediately after it.
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] there are no missing elements: [] (remember, these are the first elements of each row)
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] there are no missing elements: []
third_column: [3,6,_,4,7,1,5,8,2] there is one missing element: [9]
fourth_column: [4,7,1,5,8,2,6,9,_] there is one missing element: [3]
...
and do this for All Nine columns

## Block elements
Remember: the elements in the blocks are made from three elements each from Three Different Rows, NOT just from a single row. So the top_left_block in this example would be [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, _]], with [1,2,3] from the first_row left-three-columns, [4,5,6] from the second_row left-three-columns, and [7,8,_] from the third_row left-three-columns.
We add an extra count of the underscores in each block since this part is tricky. The underscore count will give you the EXACT number of missing candidates for each block.
Also, the missing elements given in each row and column above May Not be in order, so be Very careful to get the right elements if using them.
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, _]]
there is one underscore here
so there is one missing element: [9] (remember, these are from the first, second, AND third rows)

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, 9],
[1, 2, 3]]
there are no underscores here
so there are no missing elements: []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[_, _, 9],
[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6]]
there are two underscores here
so there are two missing elements: [7,8]

middle_left_block (rows: fourth, fifth, sixth; columns: first, second, third):
[[2, 3, 4],
[5, 6, 7],
[8, 9, 1]]
there are no underscores here
so there are no missing elements: []
...
and do this for All Nine blocks

# Candidate analysis
First section done, take a deep breath.
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
Now that we have the missing elements, we need to find the unfilled squares.
Go through each row and list JUST the column position of each unfilled/underscore element (if any) in each row.

## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (make sure to get the blocks right!).
Use the 'Block elements' section above to figure out the Correct block from the row And the column (BOTH have to match). Specifically use the lines "top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):" at the start of each block.
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the Common elements (if any) which appear in All Three missing element sets of that square.
For example:
square (1,7) (first_row, seventh_column):
first_row missing elements: [7,8]
seventh_column missing elements: [6,7]
top_right_block missing elements: [7,8]
Common elements: [7]

square (1,8) (first_row, eighth_column):
first_row missing elements: [7,8]
eighth_column missing elements: [8,4,9]
top_right_block missing elements: [7,8]
Common elements: [8]
...
and do this for All unfilled squares

We are currently in the testing phase. Do all sections exactly as instructed above, and then stop.
Make sure to do Every section in full, starting with printing the board state.

We are analyzing the following sudoku. Make sure to convert it to the Correct format when printing the board state.

## Block elements
Remember: the elements in the blocks are made from three elements each from Three Different Rows, NOT just from a single row. So the top_left_block in this example would be [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, _]], with [1,2,3] from the first_row left-three-columns, [4,5,6] from the second_row left-three-columns, and [7,8,_] from the third_row left-three-columns.
Each block and its missing elements should (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates and each number appearing exactly once.
Also, the missing elements given in each row and column above May Not be in order, so be Very careful to get the right elements if using them.
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[_, _, 9],

middle_left_block (rows: fourth, fifth, sixth; columns: first, second, third):
[[2, 3, 4],
[5, 6, 7],
[8, 9, 1]]

We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.

# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format (replace content with actual game):
## Rows
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,_,4,5,6,7]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]
eighth_row: [6,7,8,9,1,2,3,_,5]
ninth_row: [9,1,2,_,4,5,_,7,8]

## Columns
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1]
third_column: [3,6,_,4,7,1,5,8,2]
fourth_column: [4,7,1,5,8,2,6,9,_]
fifth_column: [5,8,2,6,9,_,7,1,4]
sixth_column: [6,9,3,7,1,4,8,2,5]
seventh_column: [_,1,4,8,2,5,9,3,_]
eighth_column: [_,2,5,_,3,6,1,_,7]
ninth_column: [9,3,6,1,4,7,2,5,8]

# Missing elements analysis
Now I want you to print out all twenty-seven sets to check. That's the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine 3-by-3 blocks. This is to find the candidates that are Not in each row, column, or 3-by-3 block.
At this stage DO NOT attempt to fill in any elements. All _ elements MUST remain as _ elements. This is VITAL.
## Row elements
Remember, the rows are just the rows as above.
As an example, the board state above would have the Correct element analysis:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9] missing elements: [8,7] (remember, the digits do not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there)
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3] missing elements: []
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6] missing elements: [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1] missing elements: [9]
...
and do this for All Nine rows

## Column elements
Remember, the columns are an element from the same position in Each row. So the fourth_column is the fourth element from Every row, ect.
Make sure to get All Elements INCLUDING UNDERSCORES in each column Exactly as they appear in the current game.
Make sure NOT to replace a '_' with a number Even If You Know What It Should Be. This is VITAL.
Remember, the digits Do Not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there. So if you write '[4]' and realize you also needed to add a '5', just write ', actually [4,5]' immediately after it.
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] missing elements: [] (remember, these are the first elements of each row)
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] missing elements: []
third_column: [3,6,_,4,7,1,5,8,2] missing elements: [9]
fourth_column: [4,7,1,5,8,2,6,9,_] missing elements: [3]
...
and do this for All Nine columns

## Block elements
Remember: the elements in the blocks are made from three elements each from Three Different Rows, NOT just from a single row. So the top_left_block in this example would be [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, _]], with [1,2,3] from the first_row left-three-columns, [4,5,6] from the second_row left-three-columns, and [7,8,_] from the third_row left-three-columns.
Each block and its missing elements should (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates and each number appearing exactly once.
Also, the missing elements given in each row and column above May Not be in order, so be Very careful to get the right elements if using them.
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, _]]
missing element: [9] (remember, these are from the first, second, AND third rows)

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, 9],
[1, 2, 3]]
missing elements: []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[_, _, 9],
[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6]]
missing elements: [7,8]

middle_left_block (rows: fourth, fifth, sixth; columns: first, second, third):
[[2, 3, 4],
[5, 6, 7],
[8, 9, 1]]
missing elements: []
...
and do this for All Nine blocks

# Candidate analysis
First section done, take a deep breath.
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
Now that we have the missing elements, we need to find the unfilled squares.
Go through each row and list JUST the column position of each unfilled/underscore element (if any) in each row.

## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (make sure to get the blocks right!).
Use the 'Block elements' section above to figure out the Correct block from the row And the column (BOTH have to match). Specifically use the lines "top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):" at the start of each block.
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the Common elements (if any) which appear in All Three missing element sets of that square.
For example:
square (1,7) (first_row, seventh_column):
first_row missing elements: [7,8]
seventh_column missing elements: [6,7]
top_right_block missing elements: [7,8]
Common elements: [7]

square (1,8) (first_row, eighth_column):
first_row missing elements: [7,8]
eighth_column missing elements: [8,4,9]
top_right_block missing elements: [7,8]
Common elements: [8]
...
and do this for All unfilled squares

We are currently in the testing phase. Do the all sections exactly as instructed above UNTIL you have finished 'Block elements' and are up to (but not yet started on) 'Candidate analysis', and then Stop.
Make sure to do Every required section In Full, starting with printing the board state and ending after finding all nine blocks and their missing elements.

We are analyzing the following sudoku. Make sure to convert it to the Correct format when printing the board state.

We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.

# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format (replace content with actual game):
## Rows
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,_,4,5,6,7]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]
eighth_row: [6,7,8,9,1,2,3,_,5]
ninth_row: [9,1,2,_,4,5,_,7,8]

## Columns
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1]
third_column: [3,6,_,4,7,1,5,8,2]
fourth_column: [4,7,1,5,8,2,6,9,_]
fifth_column: [5,8,2,6,9,_,7,1,4]
sixth_column: [6,9,3,7,1,4,8,2,5]
seventh_column: [_,1,4,8,2,5,9,3,_]
eighth_column: [_,2,5,_,3,6,1,_,7]
ninth_column: [9,3,6,1,4,7,2,5,8]

# Missing elements analysis
Now I want you to print out all twenty-seven sets to check. That's the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine 3-by-3 blocks. This is to find the candidates that are Not in each row, column, or 3-by-3 block.
At this stage DO NOT attempt to fill in any elements. All _ elements MUST remain as _ elements. This is VITAL.
## Row elements
Remember, the rows are just the rows as above.
As an example, the board state above would have the Correct element analysis:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9] missing elements: [8,7] (remember, the digits do not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there)
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3] missing elements: []
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6] missing elements: [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1] missing elements: [9]
...
and do this for All Nine rows

## Column elements
Remember, the columns are an element from the same position in Each row. So the fourth_column is the fourth element from Every row, ect.
Make sure to get All Elements INCLUDING UNDERSCORES in each column Exactly as they appear in the current game.
Make sure NOT to replace a '_' with a number Even If You Know What It Should Be. This is VITAL.
Remember, the digits Do Not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there. So if you write '[4]' and realize you also needed to add a '5', just write ', actually [4,5]' immediately after it.
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] missing elements: [] (remember, these are the first elements of each row)
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] missing elements: []
third_column: [3,6,_,4,7,1,5,8,2] missing elements: [9]
fourth_column: [4,7,1,5,8,2,6,9,_] missing elements: [3]
...
and do this for All Nine columns

## Block elements
Remember: the elements in the blocks are made from three elements each from Three Different Rows, NOT just from a single row. So the top_left_block in this example would be [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, _]], with [1,2,3] from the first_row left-three-columns, [4,5,6] from the second_row left-three-columns, and [7,8,_] from the third_row left-three-columns.
Each block and its missing elements should (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates and each number appearing exactly once.
Also, the missing elements given in each row and column above May Not be in order, so be Very careful to get the right elements if using them.
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, _]]
missing element: [9] (remember, these are from the first, second, AND third rows)

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, 9],
[1, 2, 3]]
missing elements: []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[_, _, 9],
[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6]]
missing elements: [7,8]

middle_left_block (rows: fourth, fifth, sixth; columns: first, second, third):
[[2, 3, 4],
[5, 6, 7],
[8, 9, 1]]
missing elements: []
...
and do this for All Nine blocks

# Candidate analysis
First section done, take a deep breath.
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
Now that we have the missing elements, we need to find the unfilled squares.
Go through each row and list JUST the column position of each unfilled/underscore element (if any) in each row.

## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (make sure to get the blocks right!).
Use the 'Block elements' section above to figure out the Correct block from the row And the column (BOTH have to match). Specifically use the lines "top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):" at the start of each block.
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the Common elements (if any) which appear in All Three missing element sets of that square.
For example:
square (1,7) (first_row, seventh_column):
first_row missing elements: [7,8]
seventh_column missing elements: [6,7]
top_right_block missing elements: [7,8]
Common elements: [7]

square (1,8) (first_row, eighth_column):
first_row missing elements: [7,8]
eighth_column missing elements: [8,4,9]
top_right_block missing elements: [7,8]
Common elements: [8]
...
and do this for All unfilled squares

We are currently in the testing phase. Do All sections exactly as instructed above, and then stop.
Make sure to do Every section In Full, starting with printing the board state and ending only After all squares and their common candidates have been listed.

We are analyzing the following sudoku. Make sure to convert it to the Correct format when printing the board state.

...
and do this for All Nine rows

## Column elements
Remember, the columns are an element from the same position in Each row. So the fourth_column is the fourth element from Every row, ect.
Make sure to get All Elements INCLUDING UNDERSCORES in each column Exactly as they appear in the current game.
Make sure NOT to replace a '_' with a number Even If You Know What It Should Be. This is VITAL.
Remember, the digits Do Not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there. So if you write '[4]' and realize you also needed to add a '5', just write ', actually [4,5]' immediately after it.

## Block elements
Remember: the elements in the blocks are made from three elements each from Three Different Rows, NOT just from a single row. So the top_left_block in this example would be [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, _]], with [1,2,3] from the first_row left-three-columns, [4,5,6] from the second_row left-three-columns, and [7,8,_] from the third_row left-three-columns.
Each block and its missing elements should (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates and each number appearing exactly once.
Also, the missing elements given in each row and column above May Not be in order, so be Very careful to get the right elements if using them.
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, _]]
missing element: [9] (remember, these are from the first, second, AND third rows)

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, 9],
[1, 2, 3]]
missing elements: []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[_, _, 9],
[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6]]
missing elements: [7,8]

middle_left_block (rows: fourth, fifth, sixth; columns: first, second, third):
[[2, 3, 4],
[5, 6, 7],
[8, 9, 1]]
missing elements: []
...
and do this for All Nine blocks

# Candidate analysis
First section done, take a deep breath.
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
Now that we have the missing elements, we need to find the unfilled squares.
Go through each row and list JUST the column position of each unfilled/underscore element (if any) in each row.
first_row: [7,8]
third_row: [3]
fourth_row: [8]
sixth_row: [5]
eighth_row: [8]
ninth_row: [4,7]

## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (make sure to get the blocks right!).
Use the 'Block elements' section above to figure out the Correct block from the row And the column (BOTH have to match). Specifically use the lines "top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):" at the start of each block.
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the Common elements (if any) which appear in All Three missing element sets of that square.
For example:
### first_row, 1 of 6!
square (1,7) (first_row, seventh_column):
first_row missing elements: [7,8]
seventh_column missing elements: [6,7]
top_right_block missing elements: [7,8]
Common elements: [7]

square (1,8) (first_row, eighth_column):
first_row missing elements: [7,8]
eighth_column missing elements: [8,4,9]
top_right_block missing elements: [7,8]
Common elements: [8]
...
and do this for All unfilled squares

We are currently in the testing phase. Do All sections exactly as instructed above, and then stop.
Make sure to do Every section In Full, starting with printing the board state and ending only After All squares and their common candidates have been listed.

prompt 1 of 2:
We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.

# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format (replace content with actual game):
## Rows
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,_,4,5,6,7]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]
eighth_row: [6,7,8,9,1,2,3,_,5]
ninth_row: [9,1,2,_,4,5,_,7,8]

## Columns
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1]
third_column: [3,6,_,4,7,1,5,8,2]
fourth_column: [4,7,1,5,8,2,6,9,_]
fifth_column: [5,8,2,6,9,_,7,1,4]
sixth_column: [6,9,3,7,1,4,8,2,5]
seventh_column: [_,1,4,8,2,5,9,3,_]
eighth_column: [_,2,5,_,3,6,1,_,7]
ninth_column: [9,3,6,1,4,7,2,5,8]

# Missing elements analysis
Now I want you to print out all twenty-seven sets to check. That's the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine 3-by-3 blocks. This is to find the candidates that are Not in each row, column, or 3-by-3 block.
At this stage DO NOT attempt to fill in any elements. All _ elements MUST remain as _ elements. This is VITAL.
## Row elements
Remember, the rows are just the rows as above.
As an example, the board state above would have the Correct element analysis:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9] missing elements: [8,7] (remember, the digits do not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there)
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3] missing elements: []
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6] missing elements: [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1] missing elements: [9]
...
and do this for All Nine rows

## Column elements
Remember, the columns are an element from the same position in Each row. So the fourth_column is the fourth element from Every row, ect.
Make sure to get All Elements INCLUDING UNDERSCORES in each column Exactly as they appear in the current game.
Make sure NOT to replace a '_' with a number Even If You Know What It Should Be. This is VITAL.
Remember, the digits Do Not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there. So if you write '[4]' and realize you also needed to add a '5', just write ', actually [4,5]' immediately after it.
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] missing elements: [] (remember, these are the first elements of each row)
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] missing elements: []
third_column: [3,6,_,4,7,1,5,8,2] missing elements: [9]
fourth_column: [4,7,1,5,8,2,6,9,_] missing elements: [3]
...
and do this for All Nine columns

## Block elements
Remember: the elements in the blocks are made from three elements each from Three Different Rows, NOT just from a single row. So the top_left_block in this example would be [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, _]], with [1,2,3] from the first_row left-three-columns, [4,5,6] from the second_row left-three-columns, and [7,8,_] from the third_row left-three-columns.
Each block and its missing elements should (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates and each number appearing exactly once.
Also, the missing elements given in each row and column above May Not be in order, so be Very careful to get the right elements if using them.
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, _]]
missing element: [9] (remember, these are from the first, second, AND third rows)

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, 9],
[1, 2, 3]]
missing elements: []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[_, _, 9],
[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6]]
missing elements: [7,8]

middle_left_block (rows: fourth, fifth, sixth; columns: first, second, third):
[[2, 3, 4],
[5, 6, 7],
[8, 9, 1]]
missing elements: []
...
and do this for All Nine blocks

# Candidate analysis
First section done, take a deep breath.
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
Now that we have the missing elements, we need to find the unfilled squares.
Go through each row and list JUST the column position of each unfilled/underscore element (if any) in each row.
first_row: [7,8]
third_row: [3]
fourth_row: [8]
sixth_row: [5]
eighth_row: [8]
ninth_row: [4,7]

## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (make sure to get the blocks right!).
Use the 'Block elements' section above to figure out the Correct block from the row And the column (BOTH have to match). Specifically use the lines "top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):" at the start of each block.
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the Common elements (if any) which appear in All Three missing element sets of that square.
For example:
### first_row, 1 of 6!
square (1,7) (first_row, seventh_column):
first_row missing elements: [7,8]
seventh_column missing elements: [6,7]
top_right_block missing elements: [7,8]
Common elements: [7]

square (1,8) (first_row, eighth_column):
first_row missing elements: [7,8]
eighth_column missing elements: [8,4,9]
top_right_block missing elements: [7,8]
Common elements: [8]
...
and do this for All unfilled squares

We are currently in the testing phase. Do All sections exactly as instructed above, and then stop.
Make sure to do Every section In Full, starting with printing the board state and ending only After All squares and their common candidates have been listed.

We are analyzing the following sudoku. Make sure to convert it to the Correct format when printing the board state.

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares

seventh_row: [1,3,4,6,9]
eighth_row: [1,4,7,8,9]
ninth_row: [1,3,5,7,8]

response:
## Common candidates in each non-filled square
### first_row, 1 of 6!
square (1,1) (first_row, first_column):
first_row missing elements: [3,9]
first_column missing elements: [1,3,4,5,6,8,9]
top_left_block missing elements: [2,3,5,6,8,9]
Common elements: [3,9]

square (1,6) (first_row, sixth_column):
first_row missing elements: [3,9]
sixth_column missing elements: [3,4,5,6,7,8]
top_middle_block missing elements: [1,3,4,8,9]
Common elements: [3]

### second_row, 1 of 8!
square (2,1) (second_row, first_column):
second_row missing elements: [1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9]
first_column missing elements: [1,3,4,5,6,8,9]
top_left_block missing elements: [2,3,5,6,8,9]
Common elements: [1,4,5,6,8,9]

... and so on for all unfilled squares.

This process will be repeated for all the unfilled squares in the puzzle. For each square, we will find the common missing elements in its row, column, and block. These common elements are the possible numbers that can be filled in the square. If there is exactly one common element, then that is the number that should be filled in the square. If there are more than one common elements, then we cannot determine the number for the square yet, and we will need to use other strategies to solve the puzzle.

prompt 1 of 2:
We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.

# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format (replace content with actual game):
## Rows
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,_,4,5,6,7]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]
eighth_row: [6,7,8,9,1,2,3,_,5]
ninth_row: [9,1,2,_,4,5,_,7,8]

## Columns
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1]
third_column: [3,6,_,4,7,1,5,8,2]
fourth_column: [4,7,1,5,8,2,6,9,_]
fifth_column: [5,8,2,6,9,_,7,1,4]
sixth_column: [6,9,3,7,1,4,8,2,5]
seventh_column: [_,1,4,8,2,5,9,3,_]
eighth_column: [_,2,5,_,3,6,1,_,7]
ninth_column: [9,3,6,1,4,7,2,5,8]

# Missing elements analysis
Now I want you to print out all twenty-seven sets to check. That's the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine 3-by-3 blocks. This is to find the candidates that are Not in each row, column, or 3-by-3 block.
At this stage DO NOT attempt to fill in any elements. All _ elements MUST remain as _ elements. This is VITAL.
## Row elements
Remember, the rows are just the rows as above.
As an example, the board state above would have the Correct element analysis:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9] missing elements: [8,7] (remember, the digits do not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there)
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3] missing elements: []
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6] missing elements: [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1] missing elements: [9]
...
and do this for All Nine rows

## Column elements
Remember, the columns are an element from the same position in Each row. So the fourth_column is the fourth element from Every row, ect.
Make sure to get All Elements INCLUDING UNDERSCORES in each column Exactly as they appear in the current game.
Make sure NOT to replace a '_' with a number Even If You Know What It Should Be. This is VITAL.
Remember, the digits Do Not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there. So if you write '[4]' and realize you also needed to add a '5', just write ', actually [4,5]' immediately after it.
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] missing elements: [] (remember, these are the first elements of each row)
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] missing elements: []
third_column: [3,6,_,4,7,1,5,8,2] missing elements: [9]
fourth_column: [4,7,1,5,8,2,6,9,_] missing elements: [3]
...
and do this for All Nine columns

## Block elements
Remember: the elements in the blocks are made from three elements each from Three Different Rows, NOT just from a single row. So the top_left_block in this example would be [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, _]], with [1,2,3] from the first_row left-three-columns, [4,5,6] from the second_row left-three-columns, and [7,8,_] from the third_row left-three-columns.
Each block and its missing elements should (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates and each number appearing exactly once.
Also, the missing elements given in each row and column above May Not be in order, so be Very careful to get the right elements if using them.
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, _]]
missing element: [9] (remember, these are from the first, second, AND third rows)

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, 9],
[1, 2, 3]]
missing elements: []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[_, _, 9],
[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6]]
missing elements: [7,8]

middle_left_block (rows: fourth, fifth, sixth; columns: first, second, third):
[[2, 3, 4],
[5, 6, 7],
[8, 9, 1]]
missing elements: []
...
and do this for All Nine blocks

# Candidate analysis
First section done, take a deep breath.
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
Now that we have the missing elements, we need to find the unfilled squares.
Go through each row and list JUST the column position of each unfilled/underscore element (if any) in each row.
first_row: seventh eighth columns
third_row: third column
fourth_row: eighth column
sixth_row: fifth column
eighth_row: eight column
ninth_row: fourth seventh columns

## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (make sure to get the blocks right!).
Use the 'Block elements' section above to figure out the Correct block from the row And the column (BOTH have to match). Specifically use the lines "top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):" at the start of each block.
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the Common elements (if any) which appear in All Three missing element sets of that square.
There are 6 rows with unfilled squares:
### first_row, 1 of 6!
square (1,7) (first_row, seventh_column):
first_row missing elements: [7,8]
seventh_column missing elements: [6,7]
top_right_block missing elements: [7,8]
Elements in ALL THREE missing element sets: [7]

square (1,8) (first_row, eighth_column):
first_row missing elements: [7,8]
eighth_column missing elements: [8,4,9]
top_right_block missing elements: [7,8]
Elements in ALL THREE missing element sets [8]
...
and do this for All unfilled squares

We are currently in the testing phase. Do All sections exactly as instructed above, and then stop.
Make sure to do Every section In Full, starting with printing the board state and ending only After All squares and their common candidates have been listed.

We are analyzing the following sudoku. Make sure to convert it to the Correct format when printing the board state.

eighth_column: [_,2,5,_,3,6,1,_,7]
ninth_column: [9,3,6,1,4,7,2,5,8]

# Missing elements analysis
Now I want you to print out all twenty-seven sets to check. That's the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine 3-by-3 blocks. This is to find the candidates that are Not in each row, column, or 3-by-3 block.
At this stage DO NOT attempt to fill in any elements. All _ elements MUST remain as _ elements. This is VITAL.
## Row elements
Remember, the rows are just the rows as above.
As an example, the board state above would have the Correct element analysis:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9] missing elements: [8,7] (remember, the digits do not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there)
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3] missing elements: []
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6] missing elements: [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1] missing elements: [9]
...
and do this for All Nine rows

## Column elements
Remember, the columns are an element from the same position in Each row. So the fourth_column is the fourth element from Every row, ect.
Make sure to get All Elements INCLUDING UNDERSCORES in each column Exactly as they appear in the current game.
Make sure NOT to replace a '_' with a number Even If You Know What It Should Be. This is VITAL.
Remember, the digits Do Not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there. So if you write '[4]' and realize you also needed to add a '5', just write ', actually [4,5]' immediately after it.
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] missing elements: [] (remember, these are the first elements of each row)
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] missing elements: []
third_column: [3,6,_,4,7,1,5,8,2] missing elements: [9]
fourth_column: [4,7,1,5,8,2,6,9,_] missing elements: [3]
...
and do this for All Nine columns

## Block elements
Remember: the elements in the blocks are made from three elements each from Three Different Rows, NOT just from a single row. So the top_left_block in this example would be [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, _]], with [1,2,3] from the first_row left-three-columns, [4,5,6] from the second_row left-three-columns, and [7,8,_] from the third_row left-three-columns.
Each block and its missing elements should (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates and each number appearing exactly once.
Also, the missing elements given in each row and column above May Not be in order, so be Very careful to get the right elements if using them.
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6],

# Candidate analysis
First section done, take a deep breath.
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
Now that we have the missing elements, we need to find the unfilled squares.
Go through each row and list JUST the column position of each unfilled/underscore element (if any) in each row.
first_row: seventh eighth columns
third_row: third column
fourth_row: eighth column
sixth_row: fifth column
eighth_row: eight column
ninth_row: fourth seventh columns

## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (make sure to get the blocks right!).
Use the 'Block elements' section above to figure out the Correct block from the row And the column (BOTH have to match). Specifically use the lines "top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):" at the start of each block.
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the Common elements (if any) which appear in All Three missing element sets of that square.
Make sure to use the sets you have JUST GENERATED! They are closest and easiest to see, giving you the LEAST mistakes. That's why we wrote them down Just There.
There are 6 rows with unfilled squares:
### first_row, 1 of 6!
square (1,7) (first_row, seventh_column):
first_row missing elements: [7,8]
seventh_column missing elements: [6,7]
top_right_block missing elements: [7,8]
Elements in ALL THREE missing element sets: [7]

square (1,8) (first_row, eighth_column):
first_row missing elements: [7,8]
eighth_column missing elements: [8,4,9]
top_right_block missing elements: [7,8]
Elements in ALL THREE missing element sets [8]
...
and do this for All unfilled squares

We are currently in the testing phase. Do All sections exactly as instructed above, and then stop.
Make sure to do Every section In Full, starting with printing the board state and ending only After All squares and their common candidates have been listed.

We are analyzing the following sudoku. Make sure to convert it to the Correct format when printing the board state.

prompt 1 of 2:
We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.

# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format (replace content with actual game):
## Rows
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,_,4,5,6,7]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]
eighth_row: [6,7,8,9,1,2,3,_,5]
ninth_row: [9,1,2,_,4,5,_,7,8]

## Columns
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1]
third_column: [3,6,_,4,7,1,5,8,2]
fourth_column: [4,7,1,5,8,2,6,9,_]
fifth_column: [5,8,2,6,9,_,7,1,4]
sixth_column: [6,9,3,7,1,4,8,2,5]
seventh_column: [_,1,4,8,2,5,9,3,_]
eighth_column: [_,2,5,_,3,6,1,_,7]
ninth_column: [9,3,6,1,4,7,2,5,8]

# Missing elements analysis
Now I want you to print out all twenty-seven sets to check. That's the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine 3-by-3 blocks. This is to find the candidates that are Not in each row, column, or 3-by-3 block.
At this stage DO NOT attempt to fill in any elements. All _ elements MUST remain as _ elements. This is VITAL.
## Row elements
Remember, the rows are just the rows as above.
As an example, the board state above would have the Correct element analysis:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9] missing elements: [8,7] (remember, the digits do not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there)
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3] missing elements: []
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6] missing elements: [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1] missing elements: [9]
...
and do this for All Nine rows

## Column elements
Remember, the columns are an element from the same position in Each row. So the fourth_column is the fourth element from Every row, ect.
Make sure to get All Elements INCLUDING UNDERSCORES in each column Exactly as they appear in the current game.
Make sure NOT to replace a '_' with a number Even If You Know What It Should Be. This is VITAL.
Remember, the digits Do Not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there. So if you write '[4]' and realize you also needed to add a '5', just write ', actually [4,5]' immediately after it.
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] missing elements: [] (remember, these are the first elements of each row)
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] missing elements: []
third_column: [3,6,_,4,7,1,5,8,2] missing elements: [9]
fourth_column: [4,7,1,5,8,2,6,9,_] missing elements: [3]
...
and do this for All Nine columns

## Block elements
Remember: the elements in the blocks are made from three elements each from Three Different Rows, NOT just from a single row. So the top_left_block in this example would be [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, _]], with [1,2,3] from the first_row left-three-columns, [4,5,6] from the second_row left-three-columns, and [7,8,_] from the third_row left-three-columns.
Each block and its missing elements should (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates and each number appearing exactly once.
Also, the missing elements given in each row and column above May Not be in order, so be Very careful to get the right elements if using them.
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, _]]
missing element: [9] (remember, these are from the first, second, AND third rows)

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, 9],
[1, 2, 3]]
missing elements: []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[_, _, 9],
[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6]]
missing elements: [7,8]

middle_left_block (rows: fourth, fifth, sixth; columns: first, second, third):
[[2, 3, 4],
[5, 6, 7],
[8, 9, 1]]
missing elements: []
...
and do this for All Nine blocks

# Candidate analysis
First section done, take a deep breath.
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
Now that we have the missing elements, we need to find the unfilled squares.
Go through each row and list JUST the column position of each unfilled/underscore element (if any) in each row.
first_row: seventh eighth columns
third_row: third column
fourth_row: eighth column
sixth_row: fifth column
eighth_row: eight column
ninth_row: fourth seventh columns

## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (make sure to get the blocks right!).
Use the 'Block elements' section above to figure out the Correct block from the row And the column (BOTH have to match). Specifically use the lines "top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):" at the start of each block.
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the Common elements (if any) which appear in All Three missing element sets of that square.
Make sure to use the sets you have JUST GENERATED! They are closest and easiest to see, giving you the LEAST mistakes. That's why we wrote them down Just There.
There are 6 rows with unfilled squares:
### first_row, 1 of 6!
(first_row, seventh_column):
first_row missing elements: [7,8]
seventh_column missing elements: [6,7]
top_right_block missing elements: [7,8]
intersection(first_row missing elements,seventh_column missing elements,top_right_block missing elements): [7]

(first_row, eighth_column):
first_row missing elements: [7,8]
eighth_column missing elements: [8,4,9]
top_right_block missing elements: [7,8]
intersection(first_row missing elements,eighth_column missing elements,top_right_block missing elements): [8]
...
and do this for All unfilled squares

We are currently in the testing phase. Do All sections exactly as instructed above, and then stop.
Make sure to do Every section In Full, starting with printing the board state and ending only After All squares and their common candidates have been listed.

We are analyzing the following sudoku. Make sure to convert it to the Correct format when printing the board state.

eighth_column: [_,2,5,_,3,6,1,_,7]
ninth_column: [9,3,6,1,4,7,2,5,8]

# Missing elements analysis
Now I want you to print out all twenty-seven sets to check. That's the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine 3-by-3 blocks. This is to find the candidates that are Not in each row, column, or 3-by-3 block.
At this stage DO NOT attempt to fill in any elements. All _ elements MUST remain as _ elements. This is VITAL.
## Row elements
Remember, the rows are just the rows as above.
As an example, the board state above would have the Correct element analysis:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9] missing elements: [8,7] (remember, the digits do not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there)
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3] missing elements: []
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6] missing elements: [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1] missing elements: [9]
...
and do this for All Nine rows

## Column elements
Remember, the columns are an element from the same position in Each row. So the fourth_column is the fourth element from Every row, ect.
Make sure to get All Elements INCLUDING UNDERSCORES in each column Exactly as they appear in the current game.
Make sure NOT to replace a '_' with a number Even If You Know What It Should Be. This is VITAL.
Remember, the digits Do Not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there. So if you write '[4]' and realize you also needed to add a '5', just write ', actually [4,5]' immediately after it.
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] missing elements: [] (remember, these are the first elements of each row)
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] missing elements: []
third_column: [3,6,_,4,7,1,5,8,2] missing elements: [9]
fourth_column: [4,7,1,5,8,2,6,9,_] missing elements: [3]
...
and do this for All Nine columns

## Block elements
Remember: the elements in the blocks are made from three elements each from Three Different Rows, NOT just from a single row. So the top_left_block in this example would be [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, _]], with [1,2,3] from the first_row left-three-columns, [4,5,6] from the second_row left-three-columns, and [7,8,_] from the third_row left-three-columns.
Each block and its missing elements should (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates and each number appearing exactly once.
Also, the missing elements given in each row and column above May Not be in order, so be Very careful to get the right elements if using them.
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, _]]
missing element: [9] (remember, these are from the first, second, AND third rows)

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, 9],
[1, 2, 3]]
missing elements: []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[_, _, 9],
[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6]]
missing elements: [7,8]

middle_left_block (rows: fourth, fifth, sixth; columns: first, second, third):
[[2, 3, 4],
[5, 6, 7],
[8, 9, 1]]
missing elements: []
...
and do this for All Nine blocks

# Candidate analysis
First section done, take a deep breath.
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
Now that we have the missing elements, we need to find the unfilled squares.
Go through each row and list JUST the column position of each unfilled/underscore element (if any) in each row.
first_row: seventh eighth columns
third_row: third column
fourth_row: eighth column
sixth_row: fifth column
eighth_row: eight column
ninth_row: fourth seventh columns

## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets.
Make sure to use the sets you have JUST GENERATED!!! They are theclosest and easiest to see, giving you the LEAST mistakes. That's why we wrote them down Right There!
There are 6 rows with unfilled squares:
### first_row, 1 of 6!
(first_row, seventh_column):
first_row missing elements: [7,8]
seventh_column missing elements: [6,7]
top_right_block missing elements: [7,8]
intersection(first_row missing elements,seventh_column missing elements,top_right_block missing elements): [7]

(first_row, eighth_column):
first_row missing elements: [7,8]
eighth_column missing elements: [8,4,9]
top_right_block missing elements: [7,8]
intersection(first_row missing elements,eighth_column missing elements,top_right_block missing elements): [8]
...
and do this for All unfilled squares

We are currently in the testing phase. Do All sections exactly as instructed above, and then stop.
Make sure to do Every section In Full, starting with printing the board state and ending only After All squares and their common candidates have been listed.

We are analyzing the following sudoku. Make sure to convert it to the Correct format when printing the board state.

prompt 1 of 2:
We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.

# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format (replace content with actual game):
## Rows
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,_,4,5,6,7]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]
eighth_row: [6,7,8,9,1,2,3,_,5]
ninth_row: [9,1,2,_,4,5,_,7,8]

## Columns
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1]
third_column: [3,6,_,4,7,1,5,8,2]
fourth_column: [4,7,1,5,8,2,6,9,_]
fifth_column: [5,8,2,6,9,_,7,1,4]
sixth_column: [6,9,3,7,1,4,8,2,5]
seventh_column: [_,1,4,8,2,5,9,3,_]
eighth_column: [_,2,5,_,3,6,1,_,7]
ninth_column: [9,3,6,1,4,7,2,5,8]

# Missing elements analysis
Now I want you to print out all twenty-seven sets to check. That's the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine 3-by-3 blocks. This is to find the candidates that are Not in each row, column, or 3-by-3 block.
At this stage DO NOT attempt to fill in any elements. All _ elements MUST remain as _ elements. This is VITAL.
## Row elements
Remember, the rows are just the rows as above.
As an example, the board state above would have the Correct element analysis:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9] missing elements: [8,7] (remember, the digits do not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there)
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3] missing elements: []
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6] missing elements: [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1] missing elements: [9]
...
and do this for All Nine rows

## Column elements
Remember, the columns are an element from the same position in Each row. So the fourth_column is the fourth element from Every row, ect.
Make sure to get All Elements INCLUDING UNDERSCORES in each column Exactly as they appear in the current game.
Make sure NOT to replace a '_' with a number Even If You Know What It Should Be. This is VITAL.
Remember, the digits Do Not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there. So if you write '[4]' and realize you also needed to add a '5', just write ', actually [4,5]' immediately after it.
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] missing elements: [] (remember, these are the first elements of each row)
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] missing elements: []
third_column: [3,6,_,4,7,1,5,8,2] missing elements: [9]
fourth_column: [4,7,1,5,8,2,6,9,_] missing elements: [3]
...
and do this for All Nine columns

## Block elements
Remember: the elements in the blocks are made from three elements each from Three Different Rows, NOT just from a single row. So the top_left_block in this example would be [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, _]], with [1,2,3] from the first_row left-three-columns, [4,5,6] from the second_row left-three-columns, and [7,8,_] from the third_row left-three-columns.
Each block and its missing elements should (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates and each number appearing exactly once.
Also, the missing elements given in each row and column above May Not be in order, so be Very careful to get the right elements if using them.
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, _]]
missing element: [9] (remember, these are from the first, second, AND third rows)

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, 9],
[1, 2, 3]]
missing elements: []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[_, _, 9],
[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6]]
missing elements: [7,8]

middle_left_block (rows: fourth, fifth, sixth; columns: first, second, third):
[[2, 3, 4],
[5, 6, 7],
[8, 9, 1]]

top_right_block missing elements: [7,8]
{4:1,7:2,8:3}
Elements that appear 3 times: [8]
...
and do this for All unfilled squares

prompt 1 of 2:
We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.

# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format (replace content with actual game):
## Rows
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,_,4,5,6,7]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]
eighth_row: [6,7,8,9,1,2,3,_,5]
ninth_row: [9,1,2,_,4,5,_,7,8]

## Columns
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1]
third_column: [3,6,_,4,7,1,5,8,2]
fourth_column: [4,7,1,5,8,2,6,9,_]
fifth_column: [5,8,2,6,9,_,7,1,4]
sixth_column: [6,9,3,7,1,4,8,2,5]
seventh_column: [_,1,4,8,2,5,9,3,_]
eighth_column: [_,2,5,_,3,6,1,_,7]
ninth_column: [9,3,6,1,4,7,2,5,8]

# Missing elements analysis
Now I want you to print out all twenty-seven sets to check. That's the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine 3-by-3 blocks. This is to find the candidates that are Not in each row, column, or 3-by-3 block.
At this stage DO NOT attempt to fill in any elements. All _ elements MUST remain as _ elements. This is VITAL.
## Row elements
Remember, the rows are just the rows as above.
As an example, the board state above would have the Correct element analysis:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9] missing elements: [8,7] (remember, the digits do not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there)
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3] missing elements: []
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6] missing elements: [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1] missing elements: [9]
...
and do this for All Nine rows

## Column elements
Remember, the columns are an element from the same position in Each row. So the fourth_column is the fourth element from Every row, ect.
Make sure to get All Elements INCLUDING UNDERSCORES in each column Exactly as they appear in the current game.
Make sure NOT to replace a '_' with a number Even If You Know What It Should Be. This is VITAL.
Remember, the digits Do Not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there. So if you write '[4]' and realize you also needed to add a '5', just write ', actually [4,5]' immediately after it.
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] missing elements: [] (remember, these are the first elements of each row)
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] missing elements: []
third_column: [3,6,_,4,7,1,5,8,2] missing elements: [9]
fourth_column: [4,7,1,5,8,2,6,9,_] missing elements: [3]
...
and do this for All Nine columns

## Block elements
Remember: the elements in the blocks are made from three elements each from Three Different Rows, NOT just from a single row. So the top_left_block in this example would be [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, _]], with [1,2,3] from the first_row left-three-columns, [4,5,6] from the second_row left-three-columns, and [7,8,_] from the third_row left-three-columns.
Each block and its missing elements should (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates and each number appearing exactly once.
Also, the missing elements given in each row and column above May Not be in order, so be Very careful to get the right elements if using them.
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, _]]
missing element: [9] (remember, these are from the first, second, AND third rows)

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, 9],
[1, 2, 3]]
missing elements: []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[_, _, 9],
[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6]]
missing elements: [7,8]

middle_left_block (rows: fourth, fifth, sixth; columns: first, second, third):
[[2, 3, 4],
[5, 6, 7],
[8, 9, 1]]
missing elements: []
...
and do this for All Nine blocks

# Candidate analysis
First section done, take a deep breath.
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
Now that we have the missing elements, we need to find the unfilled squares.
Go through each row and list JUST the column position of each unfilled/underscore element (if any) in each row.
first_row: seventh eighth columns
third_row: third column
fourth_row: eighth column
sixth_row: fifth column
eighth_row: eight column
ninth_row: fourth seventh columns

## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets.
Make sure to use the sets you have JUST GENERATED!!! They are theclosest and easiest to see, giving you the LEAST mistakes. That's why we wrote them down Right There!
There are 6 rows with unfilled squares:
### first_row, 1 of 6!
(first_row, seventh_column):
first_row missing elements: [7,8]
seventh_column missing elements: [6,7]
top_right_block missing elements: [7,8]
(first_row seventh_column candidates): [7]

(first_row, eighth_column):
first_row missing elements: [7,8]
eighth_column missing elements: [8,4,9]
top_right_block missing elements: [7,8]
(first_row eighth_column candidates): [8]
...
and do this for All unfilled squares

We are currently in the testing phase. Do All sections exactly as instructed above, and then stop.
Make sure to do Every section In Full, starting with printing the board state and ending only After All squares and their common candidates have been listed.

We are analyzing the following sudoku. Make sure to convert it to the Correct format when printing the board state.

eighth_column: [_,2,5,_,3,6,1,_,7]
ninth_column: [9,3,6,1,4,7,2,5,8]

# Missing elements analysis
Now I want you to print out all twenty-seven sets to check. That's the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine 3-by-3 blocks. This is to find the candidates that are Not in each row, column, or 3-by-3 block.
At this stage DO NOT attempt to fill in any elements. All _ elements MUST remain as _ elements. This is VITAL.
## Row elements
Remember, the rows are just the rows as above.
As an example, the board state above would have the Correct element analysis:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9] missing elements: [8,7] (remember, the digits do not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there)
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3] missing elements: []
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6] missing elements: [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1] missing elements: [9]
...
and do this for All Nine rows

## Column elements
Remember, the columns are an element from the same position in Each row. So the fourth_column is the fourth element from Every row, ect.
Make sure to get All Elements INCLUDING UNDERSCORES in each column Exactly as they appear in the current game.
Make sure NOT to replace a '_' with a number Even If You Know What It Should Be. This is VITAL.
Remember, the digits Do Not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there. So if you write '[4]' and realize you also needed to add a '5', just write ', actually [4,5]' immediately after it.
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] missing elements: [] (remember, these are the first elements of each row)
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] missing elements: []
third_column: [3,6,_,4,7,1,5,8,2] missing elements: [9]
fourth_column: [4,7,1,5,8,2,6,9,_] missing elements: [3]
...
and do this for All Nine columns

## Block elements
Remember: the elements in the blocks are made from three elements each from Three Different Rows, NOT just from a single row. So the top_left_block in this example would be [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, _]], with [1,2,3] from the first_row left-three-columns, [4,5,6] from the second_row left-three-columns, and [7,8,_] from the third_row left-three-columns.
Each block and its missing elements should (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates and each number appearing exactly once.
Also, the missing elements given in each row and column above May Not be in order, so be Very careful to get the right elements if using them.
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, _]]
missing element: [9] (remember, these are from the first, second, AND third rows)

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, 9],
[1, 2, 3]]
missing elements: []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[_, _, 9],
[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6]]
missing elements: [7,8]

middle_left_block (rows: fourth, fifth, sixth; columns: first, second, third):
[[2, 3, 4],
[5, 6, 7],
[8, 9, 1]]
missing elements: []
...
and do this for All Nine blocks

# Candidate analysis
First section done, take a deep breath.
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
Now that we have the missing elements, we need to find the unfilled squares.
Go through each row and list JUST the column position of each unfilled/underscore element (if any) in each row.
first_row: seventh eighth columns
third_row: third column
fourth_row: eighth column
sixth_row: fifth column
eighth_row: eight column
ninth_row: fourth seventh columns

## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.
Make sure to use the sets you have JUST GENERATED!!! They are the closest and easiest to see, giving you the LEAST mistakes. That's why we wrote them down Right There!
There are 6 rows with unfilled squares:
### first_row, 1 of 6!
(first_row, seventh_column):
first_row_missing_elements: [7,8]
seventh_column_missing_elements: [6,7]
top_right_block_missing_elements: [7,8]
STEP_A = first_row_missing_elements.intersection(seventh_column_missing_elements) = [7]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(top_right_block_missing_elements) = [7]
Common_missing_elements = STEP_B: [7]

(first_row seventh_column candidates): [7]

(first_row, eighth_column):
first_row_missing_elements: [7,8]
eighth_column_missing_elements: [8,4,9]
top_right_block_missing_elements: [7,8]
STEP_A = first_row_missing_elements.intersection(eighth_column_missing_elements) = [8]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(top_right_block_missing_elements) = [8]
Common_missing_elements = STEP_B: [8]
...
and do this for All unfilled squares

We are currently in the testing phase. Do All sections exactly as instructed above, and then stop.
Make sure to do Every section In Full, starting with printing the board state and ending only After All squares and their common candidates have been listed.

prompt 1 of 2:
We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.

# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format (replace content with actual game):
## Rows
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,_,4,5,6,7]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]
eighth_row: [6,7,8,9,1,2,3,_,5]
ninth_row: [9,1,2,_,4,5,_,7,8]

## Columns
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1]
third_column: [3,6,_,4,7,1,5,8,2]
fourth_column: [4,7,1,5,8,2,6,9,_]
fifth_column: [5,8,2,6,9,_,7,1,4]
sixth_column: [6,9,3,7,1,4,8,2,5]
seventh_column: [_,1,4,8,2,5,9,3,_]
eighth_column: [_,2,5,_,3,6,1,_,7]
ninth_column: [9,3,6,1,4,7,2,5,8]

# Missing elements analysis
Now I want you to print out all twenty-seven sets to check. That's the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine 3-by-3 blocks. This is to find the candidates that are Not in each row, column, or 3-by-3 block.
At this stage DO NOT attempt to fill in any elements. All _ elements MUST remain as _ elements. This is VITAL.
## Row elements
Remember, the rows are just the rows as above.
As an example, the board state above would have the Correct element analysis:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,_,_,9] missing elements: [8,7] (remember, the digits do not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there)
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3] missing elements: []
third_row: [7,8,_,1,2,3,4,5,6] missing elements: [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,_,1] missing elements: [9]
...
and do this for All Nine rows

## Column elements
Remember, the columns are an element from the same position in Each row. So the fourth_column is the fourth element from Every row, ect.
Make sure to get All Elements INCLUDING UNDERSCORES in each column Exactly as they appear in the current game.
Make sure NOT to replace a '_' with a number Even If You Know What It Should Be. This is VITAL.
Remember, the digits Do Not have to be in order, just make sure they are all there. So if you write '[4]' and realize you also needed to add a '5', just write ', actually [4,5]' immediately after it.
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] missing elements: [] (remember, these are the first elements of each row)
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] missing elements: []
third_column: [3,6,_,4,7,1,5,8,2] missing elements: [9]
fourth_column: [4,7,1,5,8,2,6,9,_] missing elements: [3]
...
and do this for All Nine columns

## Block elements
Remember: the elements in the blocks are made from three elements each from Three Different Rows, NOT just from a single row. So the top_left_block in this example would be [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, _]], with [1,2,3] from the first_row left-three-columns, [4,5,6] from the second_row left-three-columns, and [7,8,_] from the third_row left-three-columns.
Each block and its missing elements should (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates and each number appearing exactly once.
Also, the missing elements given in each row and column above May Not be in order, so be Very careful to get the right elements if using them.
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, _]]
missing element: [9] (remember, these are from the first, second, AND third rows)

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, 9],
[1, 2, 3]]
missing elements: []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[_, _, 9],
[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6]]
missing elements: [7,8]

middle_left_block (rows: fourth, fifth, sixth; columns: first, second, third):
[[2, 3, 4],
[5, 6, 7],
[8, 9, 1]]
missing elements: []
...
and do this for All Nine blocks

# Candidate analysis
First section done, take a deep breath.
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
Now that we have the missing elements, we need to find the unfilled squares.
Go through each row and list JUST the column position of each unfilled/underscore element (if any) in each row.
first_row: seventh eighth columns
third_row: third column
fourth_row: eighth column
sixth_row: fifth column
eighth_row: eight column
ninth_row: fourth seventh columns

## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.
Make sure to use the sets you have JUST GENERATED!!! They are the closest and easiest to see, giving you the LEAST mistakes. That's why we wrote them down Right There!
There are 6 rows with unfilled squares:
### first_row, 1 of 6!
(first_row, seventh_column):
first_row_missing_elements: [7,8]
seventh_column_missing_elements: [6,7]
top_right_block_missing_elements: [7,8]
STEP_A = first_row_missing_elements.intersection(seventh_column_missing_elements) = [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(top_right_block_missing_elements) = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7]
Common_missing_elements = STEP_B: [7]

(first_row seventh_column candidates): [7]

(first_row, eighth_column):
first_row_missing_elements: [7,8]
eighth_column_missing_elements: [8,4,9]
top_right_block_missing_elements: [7,8]
STEP_A = first_row_missing_elements.intersection(eighth_column_missing_elements) = [7,8].intersection([8,4,9]) = [8]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(top_right_block_missing_elements) = [8].intersection([7,8]) = [8]
Common_missing_elements = STEP_B: [8]
...
and do this for All unfilled squares

We are currently in the testing phase. Do All sections exactly as instructed above, and then stop.
Make sure to do Every section In Full, starting with printing the board state and ending only After All squares and their common candidates have been listed.

We are analyzing the following sudoku. Make sure to convert it to the Correct format when printing the board state.

# Candidate analysis
First section done, take a deep breath.
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
Now that we have the missing elements, we need to find the unfilled squares.
Go through each row and list JUST the column position of each unfilled/zero element (if any) in each row.
first_row: seventh eighth columns
third_row: third column
fourth_row: eighth column
sixth_row: fifth column
eighth_row: eight column
ninth_row: fourth seventh columns

## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.
Make sure to use the sets you have JUST GENERATED!!! They are the closest and easiest to see, giving you the LEAST mistakes. That's why we wrote them down Right There!
In our example there are 6 rows with unfilled squares:
### first_row, 1 of 6! (replace 6 with the number of rows containing any zeroes)
(first_row, seventh_column):
first_row_missing_elements: [7,8]
seventh_column_missing_elements: [6,7]
top_right_block_missing_elements: [7,8]
STEP_A = first_row_missing_elements.intersection(seventh_column_missing_elements) = [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(top_right_block_missing_elements) = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7]
Common_missing_elements = STEP_B: [7]

(first_row seventh_column candidates): [7]

(first_row, eighth_column):
first_row_missing_elements: [7,8]
eighth_column_missing_elements: [8,4,9]
top_right_block_missing_elements: [7,8]
STEP_A = first_row_missing_elements.intersection(eighth_column_missing_elements) = [7,8].intersection([8,4,9]) = [8]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(top_right_block_missing_elements) = [8].intersection([7,8]) = [8]
Common_missing_elements = STEP_B: [8]
...
and do this for All unfilled squares

We are currently in the testing phase. Do All sections exactly as instructed above, and then stop.
Make sure to do Every section In Full, starting with printing the board state and ending only After All squares and their common missing elements have been listed.
Please do not use code blocks, just plain text with simple headers as in the instructions is fine.

We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
Now that we have the missing elements, we need to find the unfilled squares.
Go through each row and list JUST the column position of each unfilled/zero element (if any) in each row.
first_row: seventh eighth columns

## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.
Make sure to use the sets you have JUST GENERATED!!! They are the closest and easiest to see, giving you the LEAST mistakes. That's why we wrote them down Right There!

Use the following format:
There are 6 rows with unfilled squares: (in our example, your number may differ)
### first_row, 1 of 6! (replace 6 with the number of rows containing any zeroes) (print the row heading only at the Start of each row)

We are currently in the testing phase. Do All sections exactly as instructed above, and then stop.
Make sure to do Every section In Full, starting with printing the board state and ending only After All squares and their common missing elements have been listed.
EXCEPT, for testing purposes do the FIRST THREE unfilled squares in the Common candidates section. ONLY when you've done the first three squares, THEN you can stop.

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
Now that we have the missing elements, we need to find the unfilled squares.
Go through each row and list JUST the column position of each unfilled/zero element (if any) in each row.
first_row: seventh eighth columns
third_row: third column
fourth_row: eighth column
sixth_row: fifth column
eighth_row: eight column
ninth_row: fourth seventh columns


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.
Make sure to use the sets you have JUST GENERATED!!! They are the closest and easiest to see, giving you the LEAST mistakes. That's why we wrote them down Right There!

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
There are 6 rows with unfilled squares: (in our example, your number may differ)
### first_row, 1 of 6! (replace 6 with the number of rows containing any zeroes) (print the row heading only at the Start of each row)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements





We are currently in the testing phase. Do All sections exactly as instructed above, and then stop.
Make sure to do Every section In Full, starting with printing the board state and ending only After All squares and their common missing elements have been listed.
EXCEPT, for testing purposes do the FIRST THREE unfilled squares in the Common candidates section. ONLY when you've done the first three squares, THEN you can stop.

We are analyzing the following sudoku. Make sure to convert it to the Correct format when printing the board state.

STEP_A: [3,9].intersection([1,3,4,5,6,8,9]) = [3,9]
STEP_B = [3,9].intersection([2,3,5,6,8,9]) = [3,9] = common_missing_elements

prompt 1 of 1:
We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace content with actual game).
We are also finding the missing elements of that set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.

We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace content with actual game).
We are also finding the missing elements of that set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
Now that we have the missing elements, we need to find the unfilled squares.
Go through each row and list JUST the column position of each unfilled/zero element (if any) in each row.
first_row: seventh eighth columns
third_row: third column
fourth_row: eighth column
sixth_row: fifth column
eighth_row: eight column
ninth_row: fourth seventh columns


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.
Make sure to use the sets you have JUST GENERATED!!! They are the closest and easiest to see, giving you the LEAST mistakes. That's why we wrote them down Right There!

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
There are 6 rows with unfilled squares: (in our example, your number may differ)
### first_row, 1 of 6! (replace 6 with the number of rows containing any zeroes) (print the row heading only at the Start of each row)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements





We are currently in the testing phase. Do All sections exactly as instructed above, and then stop.
Make sure to do Every section In Full, starting with printing the board state and ending only After All squares and their common missing elements have been listed.
EXCEPT, for testing purposes do the FIRST THREE unfilled squares in the Common candidates section. ONLY when you've done the first three squares, THEN you can stop.

We are analyzing the following sudoku. Make sure to convert it to the Correct format when printing the board state.

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
Now that we have the missing elements, we need to find the unfilled squares.
Go through each row and list JUST the column position of each unfilled/zero element (if any) in each row.
first_row: seventh eighth columns
third_row: third column
fourth_row: eighth column
sixth_row: fifth column
eighth_row: eight column
ninth_row: fourth seventh columns


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.
Make sure to use the sets you have JUST GENERATED!!! They are the closest and easiest to see, giving you the LEAST mistakes. That's why we wrote them down Right There!

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
There are 6 rows with unfilled squares: (in our example, your number may differ)
### first_row, 1 of 6! (replace 6 with the number of rows containing any zeroes) (print the row heading only at the Start of each row)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements





We are currently in the testing phase. Do All sections exactly as instructed above, and then stop.
Make sure to do Every section In Full, starting with printing the board state and ending only After All squares and their common missing elements have been listed.
EXCEPT, for testing purposes do the FIRST THREE unfilled squares in the Common candidates section. ONLY when you've done the first three squares, THEN you can stop.

We are analyzing the following sudoku. Make sure to convert it to the Correct format when printing the board state.

We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace content with actual game).
We are also finding the missing elements of that set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
Now that we have the missing elements, we need to find the unfilled squares.
Go through each row and list JUST the column position of each unfilled/zero element (if any) in each row.
first_row: seventh eighth columns
third_row: third column
fourth_row: eighth column
sixth_row: fifth column
eighth_row: eight column
ninth_row: fourth seventh columns


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.
Make sure to use the sets you have JUST GENERATED!!! They are the closest and easiest to see, giving you the LEAST mistakes. That's why we wrote them down Right There!

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
There are 6 rows with unfilled squares: (in our example, your number may differ)
### first_row, 1 of 6! (replace 6 with the number of rows containing any zeroes) (print the row heading only at the Start of each row)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements





We are currently in the testing phase. Do All sections exactly as instructed above, and then stop.
Make sure to do Every section In Full, starting with printing the board state and ending only After All squares and their common missing elements have been listed.
EXCEPT, for testing purposes do the FIRST THREE unfilled squares in the Common candidates section. ONLY when you've done the first three squares, THEN you can stop.

We are analyzing the following sudoku. Make sure to convert it to the Correct format when printing the board state.

We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace content with actual game).
We are also finding the missing elements of that set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
Now that we have the missing elements, we need to find the unfilled squares.
Go through each row and list JUST the column position of each unfilled/zero element (if any) in each row.
first_row: seventh eighth columns
third_row: third column
fourth_row: eighth column
sixth_row: fifth column
eighth_row: eight column
ninth_row: fourth seventh columns


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.
Make sure to use the sets you have JUST GENERATED!!! They are the closest and easiest to see, giving you the LEAST mistakes. That's why we wrote them down Right There!

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
There are 6 rows with unfilled squares: (in our example, your number may differ)
### first_row, 1 of 6! (replace 6 with the number of rows containing any zeroes) (print the row heading only at the Start of each row)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements





We are currently in the testing phase. Do All sections exactly as instructed above, and then stop.
Make sure to do Every section In Full, starting with printing the board state and ending only After All squares and their common missing elements have been listed.
EXCEPT, for testing purposes do the FIRST TEN unfilled squares in the Common candidates section. ONLY when you've done the first ten squares, THEN you can stop.

We are analyzing the following sudoku. Make sure to convert it to the Correct format when printing the board state.

We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace content with actual game).
We are also finding the missing elements of that set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.
We start by find the indices of the unfilled squares, then increase each by one to get the column positions.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [indices of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices + 1 = [the indices as above, but each increased by one]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

If the first line of the calculation gives row_unfilled_indices = [], immediately move on to the next row.

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [6,7] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices + 1 = [7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
There are 6 rows with unfilled squares: (in our example, your number may differ)
### first_row, 1 of 6! (replace 6 with the number of rows containing any zeroes) (print the row heading only at the Start of each row)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.
We start by find the indices of the unfilled squares, then increase by one to get the column positions.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [indices of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [the indices as above, but increased by one]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

If the first line of the calculation gives row_unfilled_indices = [], immediately move on to the next row.

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [6,7] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [7,8] (use this method exactly as done here)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
There are 6 rows with unfilled squares: (in our example, your number may differ)
### first_row, 1 of 6! (replace 6 with the number of rows containing any zeroes) (print the row heading only at the Start of each row)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

prompt 1 of 2:
We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace content with actual game).
We are also finding the missing elements of that set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.

## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.
We start by find the indices of the unfilled squares, then increase by one to get the column positions.

Note that .position() is the same as .index(), but is one indexed instead of zero indexed.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [indices of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

If the first line of the calculation gives row_unfilled_indices = [], immediately move on to the next row.

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):

STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
There are 6 rows with unfilled squares: (in our example, your number may differ)
### first_row, 1 of 6! (replace 6 with the number of rows containing any zeroes) (print the row heading only at the Start of each row)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

prompt 1 of 2:
We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace content with actual game).
We are also finding the missing elements of that set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9] first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(first_row) = [7,8]

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.
We start by find the indices of the unfilled squares, then increase by one to get the column positions.

Note that .position() is the same as .index(), but is one indexed instead of zero indexed.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
There are 6 rows with unfilled squares: (in our example, your number may differ)
### first_row, 1 of 6! (replace 6 with the number of rows containing any zeroes) (print the row heading only at the Start of each row)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace content with actual game).
We are also finding the missing elements of that set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

We will use .position(), which is the same as .index() but is one indexed instead of zero indexed.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares.
Total unfilled squares = 2 + num + num + one number per row + num = total_unfilled_squares


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
There are 6 rows with unfilled squares: (in our example, your number may differ)
### first_row, 1 of 6! (replace 6 with the number of rows containing any zeroes) (print the row heading only at the Start of each row)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares.
Total unfilled squares = 2 + num + num + one number per row + num = total_unfilled_squares


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
There are 6 rows with unfilled squares: (in our example, your number may differ)
### first_row, 1 of 6! (replace 6 with the number of rows containing any zeroes) (print the row heading only at the Start of each row)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace content with actual game).
We are also finding the missing elements of that set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows

## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)

first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)

## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares.
Total unfilled squares = 2 + num + num + one number per row + num = total_unfilled_squares

Then we cap the number of squares to list
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 10)


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
There are 6 rows with unfilled squares: (in our example, your number may differ)
### first_row, 1 of 6! (replace 6 with the number of rows containing any zeroes) (print the row heading only at the Start of each row)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

## Calculate the number of unfilled squares

We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace content with actual game).
We are also finding the missing elements of that set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares.
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = total_unfilled_squares

Then we cap the number of squares to list
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 3) = 3


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 3 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 3 out of 3 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares.
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = total_unfilled_squares

Then we cap the number of squares to list
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 3) = 3


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 3 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 3 out of 3 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku.
Print only the row version, as that's all we can output.
Also, DO NOT print ANYTHING other than the sudoku, as this section will be used automatically copy-pasted into another part of the process.
Remember, ONLY modify the squares listed in the 'Squares with exactly one common_missing_element' section, NOTHING else. This is VITAL.

We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace content with actual game).
We are also finding the missing elements of that set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares.
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = total_unfilled_squares

Then we cap the number of squares to list
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 3) = 3


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 3 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 3 out of 3 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku.
Print only the row version, as that's all we can output.
Also, DO NOT print ANYTHING other than the sudoku, as this section will be used automatically copy-pasted into another part of the process.
Remember, ONLY modify the squares listed in the 'Squares with exactly one common_missing_element' section, NOTHING else. This is VITAL.

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
For each row we do the following calculations:

first_row_unfilled_positions: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8].position(0) = [1,6]
first_row_unfilled_columns: first, sixth

second_row_unfilled_positions: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3].position(0) = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 8 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 49

Then we cap the number of squares to list
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 3) = 3

prompt 1 of 2:
We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace content with actual game).
We are also finding the missing elements of that set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares.
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = total_unfilled_squares

Then we cap the number of squares to list
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 3) = 3


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 3 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 3 out of 3 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku.
Print only the row version, as that's all we can output.
Also, DO NOT print ANYTHING other than the sudoku, as this section will be used automatically copy-pasted into another part of the process.
Remember, ONLY modify the squares listed in the 'Squares with exactly one common_missing_element' section, NOTHING else. This is VITAL.

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
For each row we do the following calculations:

first_row_unfilled_positions: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8].position(0) = [1,6]
first_row_unfilled_columns: first, sixth

second_row_unfilled_positions: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3].position(0) = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 8 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 49

Then we cap the number of squares to list
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 3) = 3

prompt 1 of 1:
We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace content with actual game).
We are also finding the missing elements of that set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares.
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = total_unfilled_squares

Then we cap the number of squares to list
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 20) = 20


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 20 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku.
Print only the row version, as that's all we can output.
Also, DO NOT print ANYTHING other than the sudoku, as this section will be used automatically copy-pasted into another part of the process.
Remember, ONLY modify the squares listed in the 'Squares with exactly one common_missing_element' section, NOTHING else. This is VITAL.

prompt 1 of 1:
We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace content with actual game).
We are also finding the missing elements of that set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares.
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = total_unfilled_squares

Then we cap the number of squares to list
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 20) = 20


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

If we are on TURN_A, go through the squares in normal order.
HOWEVER, if we are on TURN_B, go through the squares in REVERSE order, starting with the LAST unfilled square and going BACKWARDS. Make sure to still list number_of_squares_to_list squares and then stop.
Print either "We are on TURN_A and go forwards through the squares." OR "We are on TURN_B and go backwards though the squares."

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 20 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>

prompt 1 of 1:
We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace content with actual game).
We are also finding the missing elements of that set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares.
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = total_unfilled_squares

Then we cap the number of squares to list
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 20) = 20


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

If we are on TURN_A, go through the squares in normal order.
HOWEVER, if we are on TURN_B, go through the squares in REVERSE order, starting with the LAST unfilled square and going BACKWARDS. Make sure to still list number_of_squares_to_list squares and then stop.
Print either "We are on TURN_A and go forwards through the squares." OR "We are on TURN_B and go backwards though the squares."

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:

STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

If we are in TURN_B, after listing the squares with one common_missing_element, list them AGAIN in NORMAL order (top_left to bottom_right). This makes the final output easier to write.
Give this list (and ONLY) this list the heading ("Correct Order")

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>

prompt 1 of 2:
We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace content with actual game).
We are also finding the missing elements of that set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

(For the columns we explicitly write the elements of each column_missing_elements instead of the name. We only do this for the columns. The rows and blocks work well with the name instead.)

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares.
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = total_unfilled_squares

Then we cap the number of squares to list
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 20) = 20


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

If we are on TURN_A, go through the squares in normal order.
HOWEVER, if we are on TURN_B, go through the squares in REVERSE order, starting with the LAST unfilled square and going BACKWARDS. Make sure to still list number_of_squares_to_list squares and then stop.
Print either "We are on TURN_A and go forwards through the squares." OR "We are on TURN_B and go backwards though the squares."

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 20 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

If we are in TURN_B, after listing the squares with one common_missing_element, list them AGAIN in NORMAL order (top_left to bottom_right). This makes the final output easier to write.
Give this list (and ONLY) this list the heading ("Correct Order")

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace content with actual game).
We are also finding the missing elements of that set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares.
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = total_unfilled_squares

Then we cap the number of squares to list
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 20) = 20


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

If we are on TURN_A, go through the squares in normal order.
HOWEVER, if we are on TURN_B, go through the squares in REVERSE order, starting with the LAST unfilled square and going BACKWARDS. Make sure to still list number_of_squares_to_list squares and then stop.
Print either "We are on TURN_A and go forwards through the squares." OR "We are on TURN_B and go backwards though the squares."
Then print "I will now print ALL {number_of_squares_to_list} elements"

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 20 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

If we are in TURN_B, after listing the squares with one common_missing_element, list them AGAIN in NORMAL order (top_left to bottom_right). This makes the final output easier to write.
Give this list (and ONLY) this list the heading ("Correct Order")

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: TURN_A

first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]
eighth_row: [6,7,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]
ninth_row: [9,1,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]
</output>





You MUST finish ALL required sections IN FULL. ESPECIALLY the full number_of_squares_to_list amount of squares (until correctly printing "Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares", using number_of_squares_to_list instead of 20). This is VITAL!

We are analyzing the following sudoku, given Below in output tags.

prompt 1 of 2:
We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace content with actual game).
We are also finding the missing elements of that set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares.
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = total_unfilled_squares

Then we cap the number of squares to list
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 20) = 20


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
We now go through each unfilled square and Calculate the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, that is the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

If we are on TURN_A, go through the squares in normal order.
HOWEVER, if we are on TURN_B, go through the squares in REVERSE order, starting with the LAST unfilled square and going BACKWARDS.
Print either "We are on TURN_A and go forwards through the squares." OR "We are on TURN_B and go backwards though the squares."
Then print "I will now print ALL {number_of_squares_to_list} elements"

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in BOTH of row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] (elements in BOTH of STEP_A AND block_missing_elements)

Use the following format:
### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
common_missing_elements = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7]

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square with EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

If we are in TURN_B, after listing the squares with one common_missing_element, list them AGAIN in NORMAL order (top_left to bottom_right). This makes the final output easier to write.
Give this list (and ONLY) this list the heading ("Correct Order")

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: TURN_A

first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]
eighth_row: [6,7,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]
ninth_row: [9,1,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]
</output>





You MUST finish ALL required sections IN FULL. ESPECIALLY the full number_of_squares_to_list amount of squares (until correctly printing "Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares", using number_of_squares_to_list instead of 20). This is VITAL!

We are analyzing the following sudoku, given Below in output tags.

prompt 1 of 2:
We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace content with actual game).
We are also finding the missing elements of that set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares.
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = total_unfilled_squares

Then we cap the number of squares to list
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 20) = 20


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

If we are on TURN_A, go through the squares in normal order.
HOWEVER, if we are on TURN_B, go through the squares in REVERSE order, starting with the LAST unfilled square and going BACKWARDS. Make sure to still list number_of_squares_to_list squares and then stop.
Print either "We are on TURN_A and go forwards through the squares." OR "We are on TURN_B and go backwards though the squares."
Then print "I will now print ALL {number_of_squares_to_list} elements"

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 20 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

If we are in TURN_B, after listing the squares with one common_missing_element, list them AGAIN in NORMAL order (top_left to bottom_right). This makes the final output easier to write.
Give this list (and ONLY) this list the heading ("Correct Order")

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: TURN_A

first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]
eighth_row: [6,7,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]
ninth_row: [9,1,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]
</output>





You MUST finish ALL required sections IN FULL. ESPECIALLY the full number_of_squares_to_list amount of squares (until correctly printing "Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares", using number_of_squares_to_list instead of 20). This is VITAL!

We are analyzing the following sudoku, given Below in output tags.

prompt 2 of 2:
We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace content with game from PREVIOUS message output).
We are also finding the missing elements of that set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares.
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = total_unfilled_squares

Then we cap the number of squares to list
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 20) = 20


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

If we are on TURN_A, go through the squares in normal order.
HOWEVER, if we are on TURN_B, go through the squares in REVERSE order, starting with the LAST unfilled square and going BACKWARDS. Make sure to still list number_of_squares_to_list squares and then stop.
Print either "We are on TURN_A and go forwards through the squares." OR "We are on TURN_B and go backwards though the squares."
Then print "I will now print ALL {number_of_squares_to_list} elements"

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 20 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

If we are in TURN_B, after listing the squares with one common_missing_element, list them AGAIN in NORMAL order (top_left to bottom_right). This makes the final output easier to write.
Give this list (and ONLY) this list the heading ("Correct Order")

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: TURN_A

first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]

eighth_row: [6,7,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]
ninth_row: [9,1,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]
</output>





You MUST finish ALL required sections IN FULL. ESPECIALLY the full number_of_squares_to_list amount of squares (until correctly printing "Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares", using number_of_squares_to_list instead of 20). This is VITAL!

prompt 2 of 2:
We are going to analyze a sudoku style puzzle.
Our analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace content with game from PREVIOUS message output).
We are also finding the missing elements of that set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares.
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = total_unfilled_squares

Then we cap the number of squares to list
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 20) = 20


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

If we are on TURN_A, go through the squares in normal order.
HOWEVER, if we are on TURN_B, go through the squares in REVERSE order, starting with the LAST unfilled square and going BACKWARDS. Make sure to still list number_of_squares_to_list squares and then stop.
Print either "We are on TURN_A and go forwards through the squares." OR "We are on TURN_B and go backwards though the squares."
Then print "I will now print ALL {number_of_squares_to_list} elements"

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 20 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

If we are in TURN_B, after listing the squares with one common_missing_element, list them AGAIN in NORMAL order (top_left to bottom_right). This makes the final output easier to write.
Give this list (and ONLY) this list the heading ("Correct Order")

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: TURN_A

first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]

eighth_row: [6,7,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]
ninth_row: [9,1,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]
</output>





You MUST finish ALL required sections IN FULL. ESPECIALLY the full number_of_squares_to_list amount of squares (until correctly printing "Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares", using number_of_squares_to_list instead of 20). This is VITAL!

You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares.
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = total_unfilled_squares

Then we cap the number of squares to list
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 20) = 20


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

If we are on TURN_A, go through the squares in normal order.
HOWEVER, if we are on TURN_B, go through the squares in REVERSE order, starting with the LAST unfilled square and going BACKWARDS. Make sure to still list number_of_squares_to_list squares and then stop.
Print either "We are on TURN_A and go forwards through the squares." OR "We are on TURN_B and go backwards though the squares."
Then print "I will now print ALL {number_of_squares_to_list} elements"

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 20 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

If we are in TURN_B, after listing the squares with one common_missing_element, list them AGAIN in NORMAL order (top_left to bottom_right). This makes the final output easier to write.
Give this list (and ONLY) this list the heading ("Correct Order")

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: TURN_A

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares.
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = total_unfilled_squares

Then we cap the number of squares to list
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 20) = 20


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

If we are on TURN_A, go through the squares in normal order.
HOWEVER, if we are on TURN_B, go through the squares in REVERSE order, starting with the LAST unfilled square and going BACKWARDS. Make sure to still list number_of_squares_to_list squares and then stop.
Print either "We are on TURN_A and go forwards through the squares." OR "We are on TURN_B and go backwards though the squares."
Then print "I will now print ALL {number_of_squares_to_list} elements"

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 20 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares.
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = total_unfilled_squares

Then we cap the number of squares to list
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 20) = 20


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

If we are on TURN_A, go through the squares in normal order.
HOWEVER, if we are on TURN_B, go through the squares in REVERSE order, starting with the LAST unfilled square and going BACKWARDS. Make sure to still list number_of_squares_to_list squares and then stop.
Print either "We are on TURN_A and go forwards through the squares." OR "We are on TURN_B and go backwards though the squares."
Then print "I will now print ALL {number_of_squares_to_list} elements"

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 20 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

If we are in TURN_B, after listing the squares with one common_missing_element, list them AGAIN in NORMAL order (top_left to bottom_right). This makes the final output easier to write.
Give this list (and ONLY) this list the heading ("Correct Order")

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares.
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = total_unfilled_squares

Then we cap the number of squares to list
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 20) = 20


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

If we are on TURN_A, go through the squares starting from the first_row.
However if we are in TURN_B, then the first four rows were checked last time, sa we need to start from the fifth_row instead.
Print either "We are on TURN_A and starting from the first_row." OR "We are on TURN_B and starting from the fifth_row."
Then print "I will now print ALL {number_of_squares_to_list} squares"

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 20 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements SINGLE (add ' SINGLE' whenever there is a single common_missing_element, for easy searching)

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares.
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 8

Then we cap the number of squares to list
LIMIT = 10
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, LIMIT) = 8


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

If we are on TURN_A, go through the squares starting from the first_row.
However if we are in TURN_B, then the first four rows were checked last time, so we need to start from the fifth_row instead.
Print either "We are on TURN_A and starting from the first_row." OR "We are on TURN_B and starting from the fifth_row."
Then print "I will now print ALL {number_of_squares_to_list} squares"

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] (the common_missing_elements)

Use the following format:

Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] (add ' SINGLE' whenever there is a single common_missing_element, so the end would become '= [7] SINGLE')

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element. It should be marked SINGLE
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: TURN_B

first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]

You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares.
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = total_unfilled_squares

Then we cap the number of squares to list
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 20) = 20


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

If we are on TURN_A, go through the squares starting from the first_row.
However if we are in TURN_B, then the first four rows were checked last time, sa we need to start from the fifth_row instead.
Print either "We are on TURN_A and starting from the first_row." OR "We are on TURN_B and starting from the fifth_row."
Then print "I will now print ALL {number_of_squares_to_list} squares"

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 20 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements SINGLE (add ' SINGLE' whenever there is a single common_missing_element, for easy searching)

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: TURN_B

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares.
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 8

Then we cap the number of squares to list
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 15) = 8


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

If we are on TURN_A, go through the squares starting from the first_row, as normal.
However if we are in TURN_B, then the first four rows were checked last time, so we need to start from the fifth_row instead.
Print either "We are on TURN_A and starting from the first_row." OR "We are on TURN_B and starting from the fifth_row."
Then print "I will now print ALL {number_of_squares_to_list} squares and their common_missing_elements"

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 8 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 15 out of 15 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9] first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(first_row) = [7,8]

(For the columns we explicitly write the elements of each column_missing_elements instead of the name. We only do this for the columns. The rows and blocks work well with the name instead.)

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares.
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 8

Then we cap the number of squares to list
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 15) = 8


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

If we are on TURN_A, go through the squares starting from the first_row, as normal.
However if we are in TURN_B, then the first four rows were checked last time, so we need to start from the fifth_row instead.
Print either "We are on TURN_A and starting from the first_row." OR "We are on TURN_B and starting from the fifth_row."
Then print "I will now print ALL {number_of_squares_to_list} squares and their common_missing_elements"

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 8 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, first_row_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 15 out of 15 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>

The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: 


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1]) = [9]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = []
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block_missing_elements]) = [9]

Examples:
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1,2,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_left_block) = [9]

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_middle_block) = []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_right_block) = [7,8]

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares.
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 8

Then we cap the number of squares to list
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 15) = 8


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

If we are on TURN_A, go through the squares starting from the first_row, as normal.
However if we are in TURN_B, then the first four rows were checked last time, so we need to start from the fifth_row instead.
Print either "We are on TURN_A and starting from the first_row." OR "We are on TURN_B and starting from the fifth_row."
Then print "I will now print ALL {number_of_squares_to_list} squares and their common_missing_elements"

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 8 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, seventh_column_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 15 out of 15 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: TURN_B

first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0,9]

You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements present and Not present in that set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements Not present in the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.

I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: 


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1]) = [9]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = []
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block_missing_elements]) = [9]

Examples:
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1,2,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_left_block) = [9]

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_middle_block) = []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_right_block) = [7,8]

middle_left_block (rows: fourth, fifth, sixth; columns: first, second, third):



# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares.
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 8

Then we cap the number of squares to list
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 15) = 8


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

If we are on TURN_A, go through the squares starting from the first_row, as normal.
However if we are in TURN_B, then the first four rows were checked last time, so we need to start from the fifth_row instead.
Print either "We are on TURN_A and starting from the first_row." OR "We are on TURN_B and starting from the fifth_row."
Then print "I will now print ALL {number_of_squares_to_list} squares and their common_missing_elements"

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 8 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, seventh_column_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 15 out of 15 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: TURN_B

first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0,9]

You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: 


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1]) = [9]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = []
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block_missing_elements]) = [9]

Examples:
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1,2,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_left_block) = [9]

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_middle_block) = []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_right_block) = [7,8]

middle_left_block (rows: fourth, fifth, sixth; columns: first, second, third):



# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares.
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 8

Then we cap the number of squares to list
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 15) = 8


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

If we are on TURN_A, go through the squares starting from the first_row, as normal.
However if we are in TURN_B, then the first four rows were checked last time, so we need to start from the fifth_row instead.
Print either "We are on TURN_A and starting from the first_row." OR "We are on TURN_B and starting from the fifth_row."
Then print "I will now print ALL {number_of_squares_to_list} squares and their common_missing_elements"

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 8 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, seventh_column_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 15 out of 15 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: TURN_B

first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]

You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows

# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 8

Then we adjust the total_unfilled_squares based the turn:
IF TURN_A:
    adjusted_total_unfilled_squares = total_unfilled_squares
or
ELSE TURN_B:
    first_four_rows_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 4
    adjusted_total_unfilled_squares = total_unfilled_squares - first_four_rows_unfilled_squares = 8 - 4 = 4

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(adjusted_total_unfilled_squares, 15) = 8


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

If we are on TURN_A, go through the squares starting from the first_row, as normal.
However if we are in TURN_B, then the first four rows were checked last time, so we need to start from the fifth_row instead.
Print either "We are on TURN_A and starting from the first_row." OR "We are on TURN_B and starting from the fifth_row."
Then print "I will now print ALL {number_of_squares_to_list} squares and their common_missing_elements"

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 8 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, seventh_column_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 15 out of 15 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.

I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: 


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1]) = [9]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = []
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block_missing_elements]) = [9]

Examples:
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1,2,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_left_block) = [9]

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_middle_block) = []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_right_block) = [7,8]

middle_left_block (rows: fourth, fifth, sixth; columns: first, second, third):



# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 8

Then we adjust the total_unfilled_squares based on the turn:
IF TURN_A:
    print "We are on TURN_A:"
    adjusted_total_unfilled_squares = total_unfilled_squares = 8
ELSE IF TURN_B:
    print "We are on TURN_B:"
    first_three_rows_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 = 3
    adjusted_total_unfilled_squares = total_unfilled_squares - first_three_rows_unfilled_squares = 8 - 3 = 5
ELSE IF TURN_C:
    print "We are on TURN_C:"
    first_six_rows_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 5
    adjusted_total_unfilled_squares = total_unfilled_squares - first_six_rows_unfilled_squares = 8 - 5 = 3

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(adjusted_total_unfilled_squares, 15) = 8


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

If we are on TURN_A, go through the squares starting from the first_row, as normal.
If we are on TURN_B, then the first three rows were checked last time, so we need to start from the fourth_row instead.
If we are on TURN_C, then the first six rows were checked last time, so we need to start from the seventh_row instead.
Print either "We are on TURN_A and starting from the first_row." OR "We are on TURN_B and starting from the fourth_row." OR "We are on TURN_C and starting from the seventh_row."
Then print "I will now print ALL {number_of_squares_to_list} squares and their common_missing_elements"

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 8 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, seventh_column_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 15 out of 15 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_C". If it was just TURN_C, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: 


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1]) = [9]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = []
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block_missing_elements]) = [9]

Examples:
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1,2,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_left_block) = [9]

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_middle_block) = []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_right_block) = [7,8]

middle_left_block (rows: fourth, fifth, sixth; columns: first, second, third):



# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 8

Then we adjust the total_unfilled_squares based on the turn:
IF TURN_A:
    print "We are on TURN_A:"
    adjusted_total_unfilled_squares = total_unfilled_squares = 8
ELSE IF TURN_B:
    print "We are on TURN_B:"
    first_three_rows_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 = 3
    adjusted_total_unfilled_squares = total_unfilled_squares - first_three_rows_unfilled_squares = 8 - 3 = 5
ELSE IF TURN_C:
    print "We are on TURN_C:"
    first_six_rows_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 5
    adjusted_total_unfilled_squares = total_unfilled_squares - first_six_rows_unfilled_squares = 8 - 5 = 3

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(adjusted_total_unfilled_squares, 18) = 8


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

If we are on TURN_A, go through the squares starting from the first_row, as normal.
If we are on TURN_B, then the first three rows were checked last time, so we need to start from the fourth_row instead.
If we are on TURN_C, then the first six rows were checked last time, so we need to start from the seventh_row instead.
Print either "We are on TURN_A and starting from the first_row." OR "We are on TURN_B and starting from the fourth_row." OR "We are on TURN_C and starting from the seventh_row."
Then print "I will now print ALL {number_of_squares_to_list} squares and their common_missing_elements"

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 8 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, seventh_column_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 18 out of 18 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_C". If it was just TURN_C, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: 


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1]) = [9]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = []
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block_missing_elements]) = [9]

Examples:
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1,2,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_left_block) = [9]

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_middle_block) = []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_right_block) = [7,8]

middle_left_block (rows: fourth, fifth, sixth; columns: first, second, third):



# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 8

Then we adjust the total_unfilled_squares based on the turn:
IF TURN_A:
    print "We are on TURN_A:"
    adjusted_total_unfilled_squares = total_unfilled_squares = 8
ELSE IF TURN_B:
    print "We are on TURN_B:"
    first_three_rows_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 = 3
    adjusted_total_unfilled_squares = total_unfilled_squares - first_three_rows_unfilled_squares = 8 - 3 = 5
ELSE IF TURN_C:
    print "We are on TURN_C:"
    first_six_rows_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 5
    adjusted_total_unfilled_squares = total_unfilled_squares - first_six_rows_unfilled_squares = 8 - 5 = 3

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(adjusted_total_unfilled_squares, 15) = 8


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

If we are on TURN_A, go through the squares starting from the first_row, as normal.
If we are on TURN_B, then the first three rows were checked last time, so we need to start from the fourth_row instead.
If we are on TURN_C, then the first six rows were checked last time, so we need to start from the seventh_row instead.
Print either "We are on TURN_A and starting from the first_row." OR "We are on TURN_B and starting from the fourth_row." OR "We are on TURN_C and starting from the seventh_row."
Then print "I will now print ALL {number_of_squares_to_list} squares and their common_missing_elements"

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 8 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, seventh_column_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 15 out of 15 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_C". If it was just TURN_C, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: 


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1]) = [9]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = []
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block_missing_elements]) = [9]

Examples:
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1,2,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_left_block) = [9]

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_middle_block) = []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_right_block) = [7,8]

middle_left_block (rows: fourth, fifth, sixth; columns: first, second, third):



# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
We need to take the turn into account, since the turn determines our starting row.
IF TURN_A:
    print "We are on TURN_A:"
    all_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 8
    turn_adjusted_total_unfilled_squares = total_unfilled_squares = 8
ELSE IF TURN_B:
    print "We are on TURN_B:"
    fourth_to_ninth_unfilled_squares = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 5
    turn_adjusted_total_unfilled_squares = fourth_to_ninth_unfilled_squares = 5
ELSE IF TURN_C:
    print "We are on TURN_C:"
    seventh_to_ninth_unfilled_squares = 0 + 1 + 2 = 3
    turn_adjusted_total_unfilled_squares = seventh_to_ninth_unfilled_squares = 3

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(turn_adjusted_total_unfilled_squares, 15) = 8


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

If we are on TURN_A, go through the squares starting from the first_row, as normal.
If we are on TURN_B, the fourth_row onwards was Not checked last time, so we need to start from the fourth_row.
If we are on TURN_C, the seventh_row onwards was Not checked last time, so we need to start from the seventh_row.
Print either "We are on TURN_A and starting from the first_row." OR "We are on TURN_B and starting from the fourth_row." OR "We are on TURN_C and starting from the seventh_row."
Then print "I will now print ALL {number_of_squares_to_list} squares and their common_missing_elements, starting with the {row to start}"

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 8 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, seventh_column_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 15 out of 15 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_C". If it was just TURN_C, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: 


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1]) = [9]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = []
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block_missing_elements]) = [9]

Examples:
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1,2,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_left_block) = [9]

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_middle_block) = []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_right_block) = [7,8]

middle_left_block (rows: fourth, fifth, sixth; columns: first, second, third):



# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

If we are on TURN_A, go through the squares starting from the first_row, as normal.
If we are on TURN_B, the fourth_row onwards was Not checked last time, so we need to start from the fourth_row.
If we are on TURN_C, the seventh_row onwards was Not checked last time, so we need to start from the seventh_row.
Print either "We are on TURN_A and starting from the first_row." OR "We are on TURN_B and starting from the fourth_row." OR "We are on TURN_C and starting from the seventh_row."

At the most, we only want to search 15 squares. The rest will be done later.

Now print 15 squares and their common_missing_elements, starting at the start of the appropriate row (based on the turn).
ONLY stop early if you reach the last unfilled square in the sudoku, even if you have printed less than 15 squares. This is the ONLY time you can stop early.

For each square we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in the both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 15
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, seventh_column_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done 15 squares OR you have reached the end, stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 15 out of 15 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_C". If it was just TURN_C, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each non-filled square, examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: 


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1]) = [9]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = []
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block_missing_elements]) = [9]

Examples:
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1,2,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_left_block) = [9]

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_middle_block) = []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_right_block) = [7,8]

middle_left_block (rows: fourth, fifth, sixth; columns: first, second, third):



# Candidate analysis
## Listing the position of non-filled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Common candidates in each non-filled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

If we are on TURN_A, go through the squares starting from the first_row, as normal.
If we are on TURN_B, the fourth_row onwards was Not checked last time, so we need to start from the fourth_row.
If we are on TURN_C, the seventh_row onwards was Not checked last time, so we need to start from the seventh_row.
Print either "We are on TURN_A and starting from the first_row." OR "We are on TURN_B and starting from the fourth_row." OR "We are on TURN_C and starting from the seventh_row."

At the most, we only want to search 15 squares. The rest will be done later.

Now print 15 unfilled squares and their common_missing_elements, starting at the start of the appropriate row (based on the turn).
ONLY stop early if you reach the last unfilled square in the sudoku, even if you have printed less than 15 squares. This is the ONLY time you can stop early.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the 'Listing the position of non-filled squares' section.
For each unfilled square we examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements

Use the following format:
### 1 of 15
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, seventh_column_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done 15 unfilled squares OR you have done the end, stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 15 out of 15 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_C". If it was just TURN_C, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: 


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1]) = [9]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = []
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block_missing_elements]) = [9]

Examples:
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1,2,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_left_block) = [9]

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_middle_block) = []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_right_block) = [7,8]

# Finding the positions of unfilled squares
## Listing the position of unfilled squares
Before we use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 8

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(adjusted_total_unfilled_squares, 20) = 8



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the 'Listing the position of unfilled squares' section.
For each unfilled square we examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND (column_missing_elements)]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements (elements in both STEP_A AND (block_missing_elements))

Use the following format:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight
#### 1 of 20
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, seventh_column_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure Not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_C". If it was just TURN_C, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: 


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1]) = [9]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = []
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block_missing_elements]) = [9]

Examples:
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1,2,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_left_block) = [9]

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_middle_block) = []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],

# Finding the positions of unfilled squares
## Listing the position of unfilled squares
Before we use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 8

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(adjusted_total_unfilled_squares, 20) = 8



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the 'Listing the position of unfilled squares' section.
For each unfilled square we examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND (column_missing_elements)]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements (elements in both STEP_A AND (block_missing_elements))

Use the following format:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight
#### 1 of 20 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, seventh_column_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure Not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_C". If it was just TURN_C, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: 


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,5,8,3,6,9,4,7,1]) = [9]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = []
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block_missing_elements]) = [9]

Examples:
top_left_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: first, second, third):
[[1,2,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_left_block) = [9]

top_middle_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: fourth, fifth, sixth):
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_middle_block) = []

top_right_block (rows: first, second, third; columns: seventh, eighth, ninth):
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference(top_right_block) = [7,8]

# Finding the positions of unfilled squares
## Listing the position of unfilled squares
Before we use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 8

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(adjusted_total_unfilled_squares, 20) = 8



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have listed the three missing element sets for a square, list out the intersection of those sets, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to ENSURE we get the correct answer.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the 'Listing the position of unfilled squares' section.
For each unfilled square we examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND (column_missing_elements)]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] = common_missing_elements (elements in both STEP_A AND (block_missing_elements))

Use the following format:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: seventh, eight
#### 1 of 20 (that is, 1 of number_of_squares_to_list)
(first_row, seventh_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, seventh_column_missing_elements, and top_right_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [7,8].intersection([6,7]) = [7] (here we list the elements Instead of the names)
STEP_B = [7].intersection([7,8]) = [7] = common_missing_elements

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, seventh_column): [7]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure Not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_C". If it was just TURN_C, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>

You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]

eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding the positions of unfilled squares
## Listing the position of unfilled squares
Before we use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculation (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row]

Example:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [2,7,8]


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 20) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have found the three missing element sets for a square, list out the _intersection_ of those sets. That is, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to avoid confusion.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the 'Listing the position of unfilled squares' section.
For each unfilled square we examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] := common_missing_elements (elements in both STEP_A AND the block_missing_elements)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_positions: [2,7,8]
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] := common_missing_elements

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, second_column): [2]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure Not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_C". If it was just TURN_C, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: {the next turn}

You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

# Finding the positions of unfilled squares
## Listing the position of unfilled squares
Before we use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculation (example below):
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row]

Example:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [2,7,8]


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 20) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have found the three missing element sets for a square, list out the _intersection_ of those sets. That is, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to avoid confusion.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the 'Listing the position of unfilled squares' section.
For each unfilled square we examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] := common_missing_elements (elements in both STEP_A AND the block_missing_elements)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_positions: [2,7,8]
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] := common_missing_elements

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, second_column): [2]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure Not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_C". If it was just TURN_C, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: {the next turn}

first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0,9]

You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:

second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]

# Finding the positions of unfilled squares
## Listing the position of unfilled squares
To use the missing elements, we need to find the positions of the unfilled squares. That is, the positions of the '0' elements in each row.

For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_positions: row.position(0) = [positions of every '0' element in row] (ALWAYS do this line for every row)
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_positions: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].position(0) = [2,7,8] (just here we use the elements of the row)
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 20) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have found the three missing element sets for a square, list out the _intersection_ of those sets. That is, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to avoid confusion.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the 'Listing the position of unfilled squares' section.
For each unfilled square we examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] := common_missing_elements (elements in both STEP_A AND the block_missing_elements)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] := common_missing_elements

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, second_column): [2]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure Not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_C". If it was just TURN_C, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: {the next turn}

first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0,9]

You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares

total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 20) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have found the three missing element sets for a square, list out the _intersection_ of those sets. That is, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to avoid confusion.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] := common_missing_elements (elements in both STEP_A AND the block_missing_elements)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] := common_missing_elements

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 20 out of 20 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, second_column): [2]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure Not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_C". If it was just TURN_C, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: {the next turn}

first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]

You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.

We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 15) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
After you have found the three missing element sets for a square, list out the _intersection_ of those sets. That is, the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to avoid confusion.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [7] := common_missing_elements (elements in both STEP_A AND the block_missing_elements)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] := common_missing_elements

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 15 out of 15 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find any square which has EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, second_column): [2]

Make sure to list EVERY such square from the common candidates section, and make sure Not to list a square that has More or Less then one common_missing_element.

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_C". If it was just TURN_C, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: {the next turn}

first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 15) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Then, calculate the elements that are in All Three listed sets. We do this in two steps to avoid confusion, row and column in STEP_A, then STEP_A and the block in STEP_B.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.common(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both the row_missing_elements AND the column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.common(block_missing_elements) = [7] := common_missing_elements (elements in both STEP_A AND the block_missing_elements)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].common([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].common([2,9]) = [2] := common_missing_elements

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 15 out of 15 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find ALL squares which have EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, second_column): [2]

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_C". If it was just TURN_C, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: {the next turn}

first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0,9]

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 15) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
square(row, column) common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
square(first_row, second_column) common_missing_elements: [2]

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 15 out of 15 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find ALL squares which have EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, second_column): [2]

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_C". If it was just TURN_C, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: {the next turn}

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 15) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
square(row, column) common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
square(first_row, second_column) common_missing_elements: [2]

On each line in STEP_A and STEP_B make sure to use YOUR values that YOU calculated. The ones you JUST wrote down. Compare them VERY carefully and output ONLY the elements which appear in BOTH sets ON THE CURRENT LINE (the _current_ calculation).

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 15 out of 15 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find ALL squares which have EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, second_column): [2]

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_C". If it was just TURN_C, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: {the next turn}

first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 15) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
square(row, column) common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column): (Make sure for YOUR squares you pay EXTRA ATTENTION to the VERY FIRST one you do, so it DOESN'T get mixed up with the example)
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
square(first_row, second_column) common_missing_elements: [2]

On each line in STEP_A and STEP_B make sure to use YOUR values that YOU calculated. The ones you JUST wrote down. Compare them VERY carefully and output ONLY the elements which appear in BOTH sets ON THE CURRENT LINE (the _current_ calculation).

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 15 out of 15 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find ALL squares which have EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, second_column): [2]

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_C". If it was just TURN_C, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: {the next turn}

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 15) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
square(row, column) common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
square(first_row, second_column) common_missing_elements: [2]

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 15 out of 15 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find ALL squares which have EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, second_column): [2]

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_C". If it was just TURN_C, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: {the next turn}

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 15) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
square(row, column) common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
square(first_row, second_column) common_missing_elements: [2]

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 15 out of 15 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find ALL squares which have EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:

Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_C". If it was just TURN_C, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: {the next turn}

first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]

eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:

second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]

# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
square(row, column) common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]

IF STEP_B has exactly one element (such as [2]), then also print the following line:
square(first_row, second_column) common_missing_elements: [2]

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find ALL squares which have EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, second_column): [2]

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_C". If it was just TURN_C, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: {the next turn}

first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]

You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
square(row, column) common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]

If and ONLY IF STEP_B has Exactly one element (such as [2]), then also print the following line:
square(first_row, second_column) common_missing_elements: [2]
Otherwise do NOT print that line, and just continue to the next unfilled square.

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find ALL squares which have EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, second_column): [2]

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_C". If it was just TURN_C, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: {the next turn}

first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
square(row, column) common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]

If and ONLY IF STEP_B has Exactly one element (such as [2]), then also print the following line:
square(first_row, second_column) common_missing_elements: [2]
Otherwise do NOT print that line, and just continue to the next unfilled square.

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find ALL squares which have EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, second_column): [2]

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_C". If it was just TURN_C, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: {the next turn}

first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
square(row, column) common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
square(first_row, second_column) common_missing_elements: [2]

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find ALL squares which have EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, second_column): [2]

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_C". If it was just TURN_C, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: {the next turn}

first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]

## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
total_unfilled_squares = 5 + 5 + 3 + 0 + 8 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 6 = 44

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 17

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
square(row, column) common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
square(first_row, second_column) common_missing_elements: [2]

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## All squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the common candidates section and find ALL squares which have EXACTLY ONE common_missing_element.
List them ALL here in the following format:
(first_row, second_column): [2]
and more if there are more

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_C". If it was just TURN_C, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: {the next turn}

first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
square(row, column) common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
square(first_row, second_column) common_missing_elements: [2]

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the Candidate analysis section and find all squares which have exactly common_missing_element.
List them here in the following format:
(first_row, second_column): [2]

## Print the updated sudoku
Using ONLY the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku (row version only). Make sure to put the updated squares in the CORRECT positions. ONLY modify the updated squares, NOTHING else.
If it was just TURN_A, print "Turn: TURN_B". If it was just TURN_B, print "Turn: TURN_C". If it was just TURN_C, print "Turn: TURN_A".
Print ONLY the following EXACT format and NOTHING ELSE, as the number of characters must be EXACT for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
square(row, column) common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
square(first_row, second_column) common_missing_elements: [2]

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the Candidate analysis section and find all squares which have exactly common_missing_element.
List them here in the following format:
(first_row, second_column): [2]

## Print the updated sudoku
Using only the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku. Make sure to put the updated squares in the correct positions, paying particular attention to the columns.
We also need to update the turn, so also in the output:
If it was just TURN_A, then next_turn = TURN_B
If it was just TURN_B, then next_turn = TURN_C
If it was just TURN_C, then next_turn = TURN_A
Print the following exact format and nothing else, as the number of characters must be exact for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
Turn: {next_turn}

first_row: [1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]

# Finding and counting the zero elements

## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
total_unfilled_squares = 5 + 5 + 3 + 0 + 8 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 6 = 44

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 17

You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
square(row, column) common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
square(first_row, second_column) common_missing_elements: [2]

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



# Wrapping up
## Squares with exactly one common_missing_element
Look through the Candidate analysis section and find all squares which have exactly common_missing_element.
List them here in the following format:
(first_row, second_column): [2]

## Print the updated sudoku
Using only the listed squares and elements from the last section (those with exactly one common_missing_element), print the updated sudoku. Take care to put the updated squares in the correct positions.
Print the following exact format and nothing else, as the number of characters must be exact for the next part of the process to work. (include the <output> and </output> wrappers)

<output>
[1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
square(row, column) common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
square(first_row, second_column) common_missing_elements: [2]

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)



You MUST finish ALL required sections IN FULL.

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
square(row, column) common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
square(first_row, second_column) common_missing_elements: [2]

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Output
Finally, for Every unfilled square that had ONLY one commen element, we list below so they are all in one place. Make sure to get all the different parts:
square(first_row, second_column):
common_missing_elements: [2] which has only one element
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]




You MUST finish ALL required sections IN FULL.

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
square(row, column) common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
square(first_row, second_column) common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND ONE (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Output
Finally, for Every unfilled square that had ONLY one commen element (should be marked with "FOUND ONE"), we list them below so they are all in one place. Make sure to get all the different parts of each.

square(first_row, second_column) common_missing_elements: [2] Which has only one element
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Make sure to list ALL of them




You MUST finish ALL required sections IN FULL.

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
square(row, column) common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
square(first_row, second_column) common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND ONE (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Output
Finally, for Every unfilled square that had ONLY one commen element (should be marked with "FOUND ONE"), we list them below so they are all in one place. Make sure to get all the different parts of each.

square(first_row, second_column) common_missing_elements: [2] Which has only one element
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"




You MUST finish ALL required sections IN FULL.

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
square(row, column) common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
square(first_row, second_column) common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND ONE (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Output Analysis Results
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (should be marked with "FOUND ONE"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

square(first_row, second_column) common_missing_elements: [2] Which has only one element
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_candidates = [2,7,8]
second_column_candidates = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_candidates = [2,7]

Notice the two changes. We have changed the names from '_missing_elements' to '_candidates', and we have ommitted the common_missing_elements.
This is to allow programmatic verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

system_message:
Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to update specific cells of the given sudoku using the provided candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. You must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. As soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the outputted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed.

prompt 1 of 1:
<output>
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
</output>


<Cells to update>
cell(first_row, fourth_column): candidate = [5]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): candidate = [9]
</Cells to update>


# STEP_ONE: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell to be updated with the corresponding row. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no cells to be updated, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]


# STEP_TWO: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]


# STEP_THREE: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_THREE.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_THREE."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_THREE.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_FOUR: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_FIVE Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_FIVE, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

ninth_row_unfilled_columns: first, sixth, seventh

## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
total_unfilled_squares = 4 + 7 + 6 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 8 + 6 + 3 = 49

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 17

system_message:
Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

prompt 1 of 7:
Respond to this message with "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. When you receive the current sudoku in <output> tags, say only "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive the last few hundred characters of the previous analysis results. When you receive the previous results say "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive instructions. When you receive the instructions, you may begin.

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

prompt 1 of 7:
Respond to this message with "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. When you receive the current sudoku in <output> tags, say only "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive the last few hundred characters of the previous analysis results. When you receive the previous results say "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive instructions. When you receive the instructions, you may begin.

# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

Respond to this message with "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. When you receive the current sudoku in <output> tags, say only "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive the last few hundred characters of the previous analysis results. When you receive the previous results say "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive instructions. When you receive the instructions, you may begin.

# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:

# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 2 of 3:
Awaiting instructions.

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

system_message:
Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

prompt 1 of 7:
Respond to this message with "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. When you receive the current sudoku in <output> tags, say only "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive the last few hundred characters of the previous analysis results. When you receive the previous results say "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive instructions. When you receive the instructions, you may begin.

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

system_message:
Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

prompt 1 of 7:
Respond to this message with "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. When you receive the current sudoku in <output> tags, say only "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive the last few hundred characters of the previous analysis results. When you receive the previous results say "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive instructions. When you receive the instructions, you may begin.

# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

prompt 1 of 7:
Respond to this message with "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. When you receive the current sudoku in <output> tags, say only "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive the last few hundred characters of the previous analysis results. When you receive the previous results say "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive instructions. When you receive the instructions, you may begin.

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

system_message:
Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

prompt 1 of 7:
Respond to this message with "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. When you receive the current sudoku in <output> tags, say only "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive the last few hundred characters of the previous analysis results. When you receive the previous results say "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive instructions. When you receive the instructions, you may begin.

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 1 + 1 + 8 + 6 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 5 = 34

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 17

system_message:
Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

prompt 1 of 7:
Respond to this message with "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. When you receive the current sudoku in <output> tags, say only "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive the last few hundred characters of the previous analysis results. When you receive the previous results say "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive instructions. When you receive the instructions, you may begin.

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

prompt 1 of 7:
Respond to this message with "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. When you receive the current sudoku in <output> tags, say only "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive the last few hundred characters of the previous analysis results. When you receive the previous results say "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive instructions. When you receive the instructions, you may begin.

# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

Awaiting instructions.

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
total_unfilled_squares = 4 + 3 + 5 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 7 + 6 + 2 = 29

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 17

system_message:
Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

prompt 1 of 7:
Respond to this message with "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. When you receive the current sudoku in <output> tags, say only "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive the last few hundred characters of the previous analysis results. When you receive the previous results say "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive instructions. When you receive the instructions, you may begin.

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

system_message:
Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

prompt 1 of 7:
Respond to this message with "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. When you receive the current sudoku in <output> tags, say only "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive the last few hundred characters of the previous analysis results. When you receive the previous results say "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive instructions. When you receive the instructions, you may begin.

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

system_message:
Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

prompt 1 of 7:
Respond to this message with "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. When you receive the current sudoku in <output> tags, say only "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive the last few hundred characters of the previous analysis results. When you receive the previous results say "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive instructions. When you receive the instructions, you may begin.

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.

Awaiting instructions.

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

system_message:
Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

prompt 1 of 7:
Respond to this message with "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. When you receive the current sudoku in <output> tags, say only "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive the last few hundred characters of the previous analysis results. When you receive the previous results say "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive instructions. When you receive the instructions, you may begin.

# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:

cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

Awaiting instructions.

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

Awaiting instructions.

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:

# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:

# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

Awaiting instructions.

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin
