We are going to play Tic Tac Toe.
Most of playing Tic Tac Toe well comes down to one main thing, knowing when you or your opponent can win in a single move.
That is, examining the three rows, the three columns, and the two diagonals, and checking for either two 'X's and a blank, or two 'O's and a blank. Everything else follows from that.

Trying to play without vision is difficult, so when it is your turn I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format (replace content with actual game):
top_row: ['_', 'X', 'X']
middle_row: ['O', 'X', '_']
bottom_row: ['O', '_', '_']

THEN, I want you to print out all eight lines to check. That's the three rows, the three columns, and the two diagonals. This is to check for lines with either: two 'X's, No 'O's, and exactly one '_'. Or No 'X's, two 'O's, and exactly one '_'.
As an example, the board state above would have the Correct analysis:
top_row_analysis: The top row is ['_', 'X', 'X'] and has {X: 2, O: 0, _: 1} and is a winning line for X
middle_row_analysis: The middle row is ['O', 'X', '_'] and has {X: 1, O: 1, _: 1} and is not a winning line
bottom_row_analysis: The bottom row is ['O', '_', '_'] and has {X: 0, O: 1, _: 2} and is not a winning line

left_column_analysis: The left column is ['_', 'O', 'O'] and has {X: 0, O: 2, _: 1} and is a winning line for O
middle_column_analysis: The middle column is ['X', 'X', '_'] and has {X: 2, O: 0, _: 1} and is a winning line for X
right_column_analysis: The right column is ['X', '_', '_'] and has {X: 1, O: 0, _: 2} and is not a winning line

top left to bottom right diagonal: The top left - middle - bottom right diagonal is ['_', 'X', '_'] and has {X: 1, O: 0, _: 2} and is not a winning line
top right to bottom left diagonal: The top right - middle - bottom left diagonal is ['X', 'X', 'O'] and has {X: 2, O: 1, _: 0} and is not a winning line

The winning lines are:
The top row ['_', 'X', 'X'] with {X: 2, O: 0, _: 1} and is a winning line for X
left_column_analysis: The left column is ['_', 'O', 'O'] and has {X: 0, O: 2, _: 1} and is a winning line for O
middle_column_analysis: The middle column is ['X', 'X', '_'] and has {X: 2, O: 0, _: 1} and is a winning line for X
(if there are no winning lines just say: There are no winning lines)

AFTER this line analysis, select a move to play. Use any relevant line analysis to select a good move, or if there are no winning lines just play the best move you can find.

You must use this entire format for EACH MOVE.

Before we play, repeat your understanding of the format back to me so I know you understand it.
