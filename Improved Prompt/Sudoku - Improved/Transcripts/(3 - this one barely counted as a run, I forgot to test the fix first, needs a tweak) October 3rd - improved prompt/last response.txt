# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
## 1 of 2
second_row: [0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
cell(second_row, sixth_column): [8]
The 6th position of the second_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 6th position of the second_row:
second_row_three_groups_of_three = [0,6,0] + [0,0,0] + [0,0,3]
The 6th position is in the middle chunk
And 6 mod(3) = 0th (since 6 mod(3) = 0)
So we update the 0th position of the middle chunk
updated_second_row_three_groups_of_three = [0,6,0] + [8,0,0] + [0,0,3]
updated_second_row: [0,6,0,8,0,0,0,0,3]

## 2 of 2
third_row: [0,0,8,1,5,0,0,0,0]
cell(third_row, sixth_column): [6]
The 6th position of the third_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 6th position of the third_row:
third_row_three_groups_of_three = [0,0,8] + [1,5,0] + [0,0,0]
The 6th position is in the middle chunk
And 6 mod(3) = 0th (since 6 mod(3) = 0)
So we update the 0th position of the middle chunk
updated_third_row_three_groups_of_three = [0,0,8] + [6,5,0] + [0,0,0]
updated_third_row: [0,0,8,6,5,0,0,0,0]
