# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
## 1 of 4
second_row: [4,5,7,8,1,2,0,6,9]
cell(second_row, seventh_column): [3]
The 7th position of the second_row is 0, so we can proceed.
There are 7 - 1 = 6 elements before the current cell
There are also 9 - 7 = 2 elements after the current cell
So we break the current row into three groups of 6, then 1, then 2 elements
second_row_isolated = [4,5,7,8,1,2] + [0] + [6,9]
Then we update the middle isolated cell to become [3]
updated_second_row_isolated = [4,5,7,8,1,2] + [3] + [6,9]
updated_second_row = [4,5,7,8,1,2,3,6,9]

## 2 of 4
third_row: [8,2,6,9,3,5,0,1,4]
cell(third_row, seventh_column): [7]
The 7th position of the third_row is 0, so we can proceed.
There are 7 - 1 = 6 elements before the current cell
There are also 9 - 7 = 2 elements after the current cell
So we break the current row into three groups of 6, then 1, then 2 elements
third_row_isolated = [8,2,6,9,3,5] + [0] + [1,4]
Then we update the middle isolated cell to become [7]
updated_third_row_isolated = [8,2,6,9,3,5] + [7] + [1,4]
updated_third_row = [8,2,6,9,3,5,7,1,4]

## 3 of 4
fourth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(fourth_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
There are 4 - 1 = 3 elements before the current cell
There are also 9 - 4 = 5 elements after the current cell
So we break the current row into three groups of 3, then 1, then 5 elements
fourth_row_isolated = [0,0,0] + [0] + [0,0,0,8,0]
Then we update the middle isolated cell to become [5]
updated_fourth_row_isolated = [0,0,0] + [5] + [0,0,0,8,0]
updated_fourth_row = [0,0,0,5,0,0,0,8,0]

## 4 of 4
fifth_row: [9,0,0,0,6,1,0,0,0]
cell(fifth_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the fifth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
There are 4 - 1 = 3 elements before the current cell
There are also 9 - 4 = 5 elements after the current cell
So we break the current row into three groups of 3, then 1, then 5 elements
fifth_row_isolated = [9,0,0] + [0] + [6,1,0,0,0]
Then we update the middle isolated cell to become [5]
updated_fifth_row_isolated = [9,0,0] + [5] + [6,1,0,0,0]
updated_fifth_row = [9,0,0,5,6,1,0,0,0]
