# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
## 1 of 3
second_row: [0,6,0,7,2,8,0,9,3]
cell(second_row, first_column): [5]
The 1st position of the second_row is 0, so we can proceed.
There are 1 - 1 = 0 elements before the current cell
There are also 9 - 1 = 8 elements after the current cell
We break the current row into three groups of 0, then 1, then 8 elements
second_row_isolated = [] + [0] + [6,0,7,2,8,0,9,3]
Then we update middle isolated cell to become a [5]
updated_second_row_isolated = [] + [5] + [6,0,7,2,8,0,9,3]
updated_second_row = [5,6,0,7,2,8,0,9,3]

## 2 of 3
third_row: [0,0,8,1,5,6,0,0,0]
cell(third_row, seventh_column): [2]
The 7th position of the third_row is 0, so we can proceed.
There are 7 - 1 = 6 elements before the current cell
There are also 9 - 7 = 2 elements after the current cell
We break the current row into three groups of 6, then 1, then 2 elements
third_row_isolated = [0,0,8,1,5,6] + [0] + [0,0]
Then we update middle isolated cell to become a [2]
updated_third_row_isolated = [0,0,8,1,5,6] + [2] + [0,0]
updated_third_row = [0,0,8,1,5,6,2,0,0]

## 3 of 3
seventh_row: [0,4,0,0,7,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the seventh_row is 0, so we can proceed.
There are 4 - 1 = 3 elements before the current cell
There are also 9 - 4 = 5 elements after the current cell
We break the current row into three groups of 3, then 1, then 5 elements
seventh_row_isolated = [0,4,0] + [0] + [7,0,0,8,0]
Then we update middle isolated cell to become a [5]
updated_seventh_row_isolated = [0,4,0] + [5] + [7,0,0,8,0]
updated_seventh_row = [0,4,0,5,7,0,0,8,0]
