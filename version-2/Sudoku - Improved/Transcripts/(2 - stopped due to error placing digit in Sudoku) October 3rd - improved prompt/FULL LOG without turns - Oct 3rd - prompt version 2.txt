prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

system_message:
Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells using the given information, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

prompt 1 of 7:
Respond to this message with "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. When you receive the current sudoku in <output> tags, say only "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive the last few hundred characters of the previous analysis results. When you receive the previous results say "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive instructions. When you receive the instructions, you may begin.

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the text in the "Unbiased Results" section of my previous message. Ignore all text before that section (of my previous message) as was part of the working out (and may be cutoff at the beginning).
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells, then to update the verified ones in the Sudoku.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
    - Update and rotate the Sudoku, then output it.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the <analysis output></analysis output> tag in the '# Unbiased Results' section of my previous message. Only use the extracted results, nothing else from that message.
- If you do not see the '# Unbiased Results' header or the opening analysis output tag, that means they were cut off when the results were extracted. In that case, make sure the message ends in the closing analysis output tag and take the last six COMPLETE cells given. Make sure NOT to take a partial cell, look for each the starting word 'cell'.
- There should only be a maximum of six cells given in my previous message. If there is more than that, take ONLY a maximum of SIX cells, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the extracted text from the analysis output tag under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading or the tags from the previous message.
- When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- Find the shortest list out of the row, column, or block.
- Break up the lists into two lists each:
    - '{list_name}_low' containing all digits in the list up to 5 (the 'low' digits)
    - '{list_name}_high' containing all digits in the list from 6 upwards (the 'high' digits)
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits of the shortest set. The candidates are a subset of each of the three sets, and the shortest set gives the least digits to search.
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in each appropriate list using list.count(digit).
    - After that on the same line, sum the counts that line to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 2, immediately print "FOUND A CANDIDATE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 2 (marked by 'FOUND A CANDIDATE') and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 6 cells, cap the number to check at 6.
- The example names start with 'example_'. Yours will not.

- Example:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(example_second_row, example_first_column):

example_second_row_candidates.length = 6
example_first_column_candidates.length = 6
example_top_left_block_candidates.length = 5

shortest_list = example_top_left_block_candidates = digits to search

example_second_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6,7,9], broken into example_second_row_candidates_low = [1,2,4] and example_second_row_candidates_high = [6,7,9]
example_first_column_candidates = [1,3,4,5,6,9], broken into example_first_column_candidates_low = [1,3,4,5] and example_first_column_candidates_high = [6,9]
example_top_left_block_candidates = [2,3,6,8,9], broken into example_top_left_block_candidates_low = [2,3] and example_top_left_block_candidates_high = [6,8,9]

Checking example_top_left_block_candidates_low digits against: example_second_row_candidates_low and example_first_column_candidates_low

3: [1,2,4].count(3) = 0, [1,3,4,5].count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1

Checking example_top_left_block_candidates_high digits against: example_second_row_candidates_high and example_first_column_candidates_high
6: [6,7,9].count(6) = 1, [6,9].count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 2 FOUND A CANDIDATE
8: [6,7,9].count(8) = 0, [6,9].count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 0
9: [6,7,9].count(9) = 1, [6,9].count(9) = 1, total_count(9) = 2 FOUND A CANDIDATE

Confirmed candidates found for cell(example_second_row, example_first_column): [6,9]


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Examples:
cell(example_second_row, example_first_column): [6,9]
[6,9].length = 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
[1].length = 1
length is 1, Passes

cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]
[2].length = 1
length is 1, Passes

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- In this step, don't print the whole Sudoku, only the rows and cells to be updated.

- Example:
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]

example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,0,1,0,0,6,4]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
The 8th position of the example_third_row is 4, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.

example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,0,1,0,0,6,4]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]
The 4th position of the example_fifth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the example_fifth_row:
example_updated_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The row to update is example_fifth_row
Using the contents of example_updated_fifth_row
example_first_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_second_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
example_fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4] (updated)
example_sixth_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- This will shift the rows to the following order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.
- Make sure to use the updated Sudoku from STEP_SIX

- Example:
example_fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]
example_sixth_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
example_first_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_second_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the rows of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
example_first_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_second_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]
example_third_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_fourth_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_sixth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
example_seventh_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_eighth_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_ninth_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

system_message:
Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells using the given information, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

prompt 1 of 7:
Respond to this message with "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. When you receive the current sudoku in <output> tags, say only "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive the last few hundred characters of the previous analysis results. When you receive the previous results say "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive instructions. When you receive the instructions, you may begin.

# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the text in the "Unbiased Results" section of my previous message. Ignore all text before that section (of my previous message) as was part of the working out (and may be cutoff at the beginning).
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells, then to update the verified ones in the Sudoku.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
    - Update and rotate the Sudoku, then output it.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the <analysis output></analysis output> tag in the '# Unbiased Results' section of my previous message. Only use the extracted results, nothing else from that message.
- If you do not see the '# Unbiased Results' header or the opening analysis output tag, that means they were cut off when the results were extracted. In that case, make sure the message ends in the closing analysis output tag and take the last six COMPLETE cells given. Make sure NOT to take a partial cell, look for each the starting word 'cell'.
- There should only be a maximum of six cells given in my previous message. If there is more than that, take ONLY a maximum of SIX cells, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the extracted text from the analysis output tag under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading or the tags from the previous message.
- When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- Find the shortest list out of the row, column, or block.
- Break up the lists into two lists each:
    - '{list_name}_low' containing all digits in the list up to 5 (the 'low' digits)
    - '{list_name}_high' containing all digits in the list from 6 upwards (the 'high' digits)
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits of the shortest set. The candidates are a subset of each of the three sets, and the shortest set gives the least digits to search.
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in each appropriate list using list.count(digit).
    - After that on the same line, sum the counts that line to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 2, immediately print "FOUND A CANDIDATE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 2 (marked by 'FOUND A CANDIDATE') and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 6 cells, cap the number to check at 6.
- The example names start with 'example_'. Yours will not.

- Example:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(example_second_row, example_first_column):

example_second_row_candidates.length = 6
example_first_column_candidates.length = 6
example_top_left_block_candidates.length = 5

shortest_list = example_top_left_block_candidates = digits to search

example_second_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6,7,9], broken into example_second_row_candidates_low = [1,2,4] and example_second_row_candidates_high = [6,7,9]
example_first_column_candidates = [1,3,4,5,6,9], broken into example_first_column_candidates_low = [1,3,4,5] and example_first_column_candidates_high = [6,9]
example_top_left_block_candidates = [2,3,6,8,9], broken into example_top_left_block_candidates_low = [2,3] and example_top_left_block_candidates_high = [6,8,9]

Checking example_top_left_block_candidates_low digits against: example_second_row_candidates_low and example_first_column_candidates_low
2: [1,2,4].count(2) = 1, [1,3,4,5].count(2) = 0, total_count(2) = 1
3: [1,2,4].count(3) = 0, [1,3,4,5].count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1

Checking example_top_left_block_candidates_high digits against: example_second_row_candidates_high and example_first_column_candidates_high
6: [6,7,9].count(6) = 1, [6,9].count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 2 FOUND A CANDIDATE
8: [6,7,9].count(8) = 0, [6,9].count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 0
9: [6,7,9].count(9) = 1, [6,9].count(9) = 1, total_count(9) = 2 FOUND A CANDIDATE

Confirmed candidates found for cell(example_second_row, example_first_column): [6,9]


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Examples:
cell(example_second_row, example_first_column): [6,9]
[6,9].length = 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
[1].length = 1
length is 1, Passes

cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]
[2].length = 1
length is 1, Passes

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- In this step, don't print the whole Sudoku, only the rows and cells to be updated.

- Example:
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]

example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,0,1,0,0,6,4]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
The 8th position of the example_third_row is 4, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.

example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,0,1,0,0,6,4]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]
The 4th position of the example_fifth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the example_fifth_row:
example_updated_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The row to update is example_fifth_row
Using the contents of example_updated_fifth_row
example_first_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_second_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
example_fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4] (updated)
example_sixth_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- This will shift the rows to the following order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.
- Make sure to use the updated Sudoku from STEP_SIX

- Example:
example_fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]
example_sixth_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
example_first_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_second_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the rows of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
example_first_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_second_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]
example_third_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_fourth_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_sixth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
example_seventh_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_eighth_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_ninth_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

Awaiting instructions.

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the text in the "Unbiased Results" section of my previous message. Ignore all text before that section (of my previous message) as was part of the working out (and may be cutoff at the beginning).
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells, then to update the verified ones in the Sudoku.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
    - Update and rotate the Sudoku, then output it.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the <analysis output></analysis output> tag in the '# Unbiased Results' section of my previous message. Only use the extracted results, nothing else from that message.
- If you do not see the '# Unbiased Results' header or the opening analysis output tag, that means they were cut off when the results were extracted. In that case, make sure the message ends in the closing analysis output tag and take the last six COMPLETE cells given. Make sure NOT to take a partial cell, look for each the starting word 'cell'.
- There should only be a maximum of six cells given in my previous message. If there is more than that, take ONLY a maximum of SIX cells, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the extracted text from the analysis output tag under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading or the tags from the previous message.
- When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- Find the shortest list out of the row, column, or block.
- Break up the lists into two lists each:
    - '{list_name}_low' containing all digits in the list up to 5 (the 'low' digits)
    - '{list_name}_high' containing all digits in the list from 6 upwards (the 'high' digits)
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits of the shortest set. The candidates are a subset of each of the three sets, and the shortest set gives the least digits to search.
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in each appropriate list using list.count(digit).
    - After that on the same line, sum the counts that line to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 2, immediately print "FOUND A CANDIDATE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 2 (marked by 'FOUND A CANDIDATE') and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 6 cells, cap the number to check at 6.
- The example names start with 'example_'. Yours will not.

- Example:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(example_second_row, example_first_column):

example_second_row_candidates.length = 6
example_first_column_candidates.length = 6
example_top_left_block_candidates.length = 5

shortest_list = example_top_left_block_candidates = digits to search

example_second_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6,7,9], broken into example_second_row_candidates_low = [1,2,4] and example_second_row_candidates_high = [6,7,9]
example_first_column_candidates = [1,3,4,5,6,9], broken into example_first_column_candidates_low = [1,3,4,5] and example_first_column_candidates_high = [6,9]
example_top_left_block_candidates = [2,3,6,8,9], broken into example_top_left_block_candidates_low = [2,3] and example_top_left_block_candidates_high = [6,8,9]

Checking example_top_left_block_candidates_low digits against: example_second_row_candidates_low and example_first_column_candidates_low
2: [1,2,4].count(2) = 1, [1,3,4,5].count(2) = 0, total_count(2) = 1
3: [1,2,4].count(3) = 0, [1,3,4,5].count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1

Checking example_top_left_block_candidates_high digits against: example_second_row_candidates_high and example_first_column_candidates_high
6: [6,7,9].count(6) = 1, [6,9].count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 2 FOUND A CANDIDATE
8: [6,7,9].count(8) = 0, [6,9].count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 0
9: [6,7,9].count(9) = 1, [6,9].count(9) = 1, total_count(9) = 2 FOUND A CANDIDATE

Confirmed candidates found for cell(example_second_row, example_first_column): [6,9]


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Examples:
cell(example_second_row, example_first_column): [6,9]
[6,9].length = 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
[1].length = 1
length is 1, Passes

cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]
[2].length = 1
length is 1, Passes

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- In this step, don't print the whole Sudoku, only the rows and cells to be updated.

- Example:
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]

example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,0,1,0,0,6,4]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
The 8th position of the example_third_row is 4, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.

example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,0,1,0,0,6,4]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]
The 4th position of the example_fifth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the example_fifth_row:
example_updated_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The row to update is example_fifth_row
Using the contents of example_updated_fifth_row
example_first_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_second_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
example_fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4] (updated)
example_sixth_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- This will shift the rows to the following order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.
- Make sure to use the updated Sudoku from STEP_SIX

- Example:
example_fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]
example_sixth_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
example_first_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_second_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the rows of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
example_first_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_second_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]
example_third_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_fourth_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_sixth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
example_seventh_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_eighth_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_ninth_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells using the given information, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the text in the "Unbiased Results" section of my previous message. Ignore all text before that section (of my previous message) as was part of the working out (and may be cutoff at the beginning).
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells, then to update the verified ones in the Sudoku.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
    - Update and rotate the Sudoku, then output it.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the <analysis output></analysis output> tag in the '# Unbiased Results' section of my previous message. Only use the extracted results, nothing else from that message.
- If you do not see the '# Unbiased Results' header or the opening analysis output tag, that means they were cut off when the results were extracted. In that case, make sure the message ends in the closing analysis output tag and take the last six COMPLETE cells given. Make sure NOT to take a partial cell, look for each the starting word 'cell'.
- There should only be a maximum of six cells given in my previous message. If there is more than that, take ONLY a maximum of SIX cells, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the extracted text from the analysis output tag under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading or the tags from the previous message.
- When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- Find the shortest list out of the row, column, or block.
- Break up the lists into two lists each:
    - '{list_name}_low' containing all digits in the list up to 5 (the 'low' digits)
    - '{list_name}_high' containing all digits in the list from 6 upwards (the 'high' digits)
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits of the shortest set. The candidates are a subset of each of the three sets, and the shortest set gives the least digits to search.
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in each appropriate list using list.count(digit).
    - After that on the same line, sum the counts that line to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 2, immediately print "FOUND A CANDIDATE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 2 (marked by 'FOUND A CANDIDATE') and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 6 cells, cap the number to check at 6.
- The example names start with 'example_'. Yours will not.

- Example:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(example_second_row, example_first_column):

example_second_row_candidates.length = 6
example_first_column_candidates.length = 6
example_top_left_block_candidates.length = 5

shortest_list = example_top_left_block_candidates = digits to search

example_second_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6,7,9], broken into example_second_row_candidates_low = [1,2,4] and example_second_row_candidates_high = [6,7,9]
example_first_column_candidates = [1,3,4,5,6,9], broken into example_first_column_candidates_low = [1,3,4,5] and example_first_column_candidates_high = [6,9]
example_top_left_block_candidates = [2,3,6,8,9], broken into example_top_left_block_candidates_low = [2,3] and example_top_left_block_candidates_high = [6,8,9]

Checking example_top_left_block_candidates_low digits against: example_second_row_candidates_low and example_first_column_candidates_low
2: [1,2,4].count(2) = 1, [1,3,4,5].count(2) = 0, total_count(2) = 1
3: [1,2,4].count(3) = 0, [1,3,4,5].count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1

Checking example_top_left_block_candidates_high digits against: example_second_row_candidates_high and example_first_column_candidates_high
6: [6,7,9].count(6) = 1, [6,9].count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 2 FOUND A CANDIDATE
8: [6,7,9].count(8) = 0, [6,9].count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 0
9: [6,7,9].count(9) = 1, [6,9].count(9) = 1, total_count(9) = 2 FOUND A CANDIDATE

Confirmed candidates found for cell(example_second_row, example_first_column): [6,9]


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Examples:
cell(example_second_row, example_first_column): [6,9]
[6,9].length = 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
[1].length = 1
length is 1, Passes

cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]
[2].length = 1
length is 1, Passes

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- In this step, don't print the whole Sudoku, only the rows and cells to be updated.

- Example:
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]

example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,0,1,0,0,6,4]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
The 8th position of the example_third_row is 4, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.

example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,0,1,0,0,6,4]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]
The 4th position of the example_fifth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the example_fifth_row:
example_updated_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The row to update is example_fifth_row
Using the contents of example_updated_fifth_row
example_first_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_second_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
example_fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4] (updated)
example_sixth_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- This will shift the rows to the following order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.
- Make sure to use the updated Sudoku from STEP_SIX

- Example:
example_fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]
example_sixth_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
example_first_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_second_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the rows of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
example_first_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_second_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]
example_third_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_fourth_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_sixth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
example_seventh_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_eighth_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_ninth_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []

# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

system_message:
Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells using the given information, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

prompt 1 of 7:
Respond to this message with "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. When you receive the current sudoku in <output> tags, say only "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive the last few hundred characters of the previous analysis results. When you receive the previous results say "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive instructions. When you receive the instructions, you may begin.

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the text in the "Unbiased Results" section of my previous message. Ignore all text before that section (of my previous message) as was part of the working out (and may be cutoff at the beginning).
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells, then to update the verified ones in the Sudoku.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
    - Update and rotate the Sudoku, then output it.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the <analysis output></analysis output> tag in the '# Unbiased Results' section of my previous message. Only use the extracted results, nothing else from that message.
- If you do not see the '# Unbiased Results' header or the opening analysis output tag, that means they were cut off when the results were extracted. In that case, make sure the message ends in the closing analysis output tag and take the last six COMPLETE cells given. Make sure NOT to take a partial cell, look for each the starting word 'cell'.
- There should only be a maximum of six cells given in my previous message. If there is more than that, take ONLY a maximum of SIX cells, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the extracted text from the analysis output tag under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading or the tags from the previous message.
- When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- Find the shortest list out of the row, column, or block.
- Break up the lists into two lists each:
    - '{list_name}_low' containing all digits in the list up to 5 (the 'low' digits)
    - '{list_name}_high' containing all digits in the list from 6 upwards (the 'high' digits)
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits of the shortest set. The candidates are a subset of each of the three sets, and the shortest set gives the least digits to search.
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in each appropriate list using list.count(digit).
    - After that on the same line, sum the counts that line to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 2, immediately print "FOUND A CANDIDATE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 2 (marked by 'FOUND A CANDIDATE') and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 6 cells, cap the number to check at 6.
- The example names start with 'example_'. Yours will not.

- Example:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(example_second_row, example_first_column):

example_second_row_candidates.length = 6
example_first_column_candidates.length = 6
example_top_left_block_candidates.length = 5

shortest_list = example_top_left_block_candidates = digits to search

example_second_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6,7,9], broken into example_second_row_candidates_low = [1,2,4] and example_second_row_candidates_high = [6,7,9]
example_first_column_candidates = [1,3,4,5,6,9], broken into example_first_column_candidates_low = [1,3,4,5] and example_first_column_candidates_high = [6,9]
example_top_left_block_candidates = [2,3,6,8,9], broken into example_top_left_block_candidates_low = [2,3] and example_top_left_block_candidates_high = [6,8,9]

Checking example_top_left_block_candidates_low digits against: example_second_row_candidates_low and example_first_column_candidates_low
2: [1,2,4].count(2) = 1, [1,3,4,5].count(2) = 0, total_count(2) = 1
3: [1,2,4].count(3) = 0, [1,3,4,5].count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1

Checking example_top_left_block_candidates_high digits against: example_second_row_candidates_high and example_first_column_candidates_high
6: [6,7,9].count(6) = 1, [6,9].count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 2 FOUND A CANDIDATE
8: [6,7,9].count(8) = 0, [6,9].count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 0
9: [6,7,9].count(9) = 1, [6,9].count(9) = 1, total_count(9) = 2 FOUND A CANDIDATE

Confirmed candidates found for cell(example_second_row, example_first_column): [6,9]


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Examples:
cell(example_second_row, example_first_column): [6,9]
[6,9].length = 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
[1].length = 1
length is 1, Passes

cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]
[2].length = 1
length is 1, Passes

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- In this step, don't print the whole Sudoku, only the rows and cells to be updated.

- Example:
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]

example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,0,1,0,0,6,4]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
The 8th position of the example_third_row is 4, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.

example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,0,1,0,0,6,4]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]
The 4th position of the example_fifth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the example_fifth_row:
example_updated_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The row to update is example_fifth_row
Using the contents of example_updated_fifth_row
example_first_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_second_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
example_fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4] (updated)
example_sixth_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- This will shift the rows to the following order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.
- Make sure to use the updated Sudoku from STEP_SIX

- Example:
example_fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]
example_sixth_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
example_first_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_second_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the rows of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
example_first_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_second_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]
example_third_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_fourth_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_sixth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
example_seventh_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_eighth_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_ninth_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the text in the "Unbiased Results" section of my previous message. Ignore all text before that section (of my previous message) as was part of the working out (and may be cutoff at the beginning).
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells, then to update the verified ones in the Sudoku.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
    - Update and rotate the Sudoku, then output it.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the <analysis output></analysis output> tag in the '# Unbiased Results' section of my previous message. Only use the extracted results, nothing else from that message.
- If you do not see the '# Unbiased Results' header or the opening analysis output tag, that means they were cut off when the results were extracted. In that case, make sure the message ends in the closing analysis output tag and take the last six COMPLETE cells given. Make sure NOT to take a partial cell, look for each the starting word 'cell'.
- There should only be a maximum of six cells given in my previous message. If there is more than that, take ONLY a maximum of SIX cells, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the extracted text from the analysis output tag under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading or the tags from the previous message.
- When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- Find the shortest list out of the row, column, or block.
- Break up the lists into two lists each:
    - '{list_name}_low' containing all digits in the list up to 5 (the 'low' digits)
    - '{list_name}_high' containing all digits in the list from 6 upwards (the 'high' digits)
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits of the shortest set. The candidates are a subset of each of the three sets, and the shortest set gives the least digits to search.
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in each appropriate list using list.count(digit).
    - After that on the same line, sum the counts that line to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 2, immediately print "FOUND A CANDIDATE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 2 (marked by 'FOUND A CANDIDATE') and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 6 cells, cap the number to check at 6.
- The example names start with 'example_'. Yours will not.

- Example:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(example_second_row, example_first_column):

example_second_row_candidates.length = 6
example_first_column_candidates.length = 6
example_top_left_block_candidates.length = 5

shortest_list = example_top_left_block_candidates = digits to search

example_second_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6,7,9], broken into example_second_row_candidates_low = [1,2,4] and example_second_row_candidates_high = [6,7,9]
example_first_column_candidates = [1,3,4,5,6,9], broken into example_first_column_candidates_low = [1,3,4,5] and example_first_column_candidates_high = [6,9]
example_top_left_block_candidates = [2,3,6,8,9], broken into example_top_left_block_candidates_low = [2,3] and example_top_left_block_candidates_high = [6,8,9]

Checking example_top_left_block_candidates_low digits against: example_second_row_candidates_low and example_first_column_candidates_low
2: [1,2,4].count(2) = 1, [1,3,4,5].count(2) = 0, total_count(2) = 1
3: [1,2,4].count(3) = 0, [1,3,4,5].count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1

Checking example_top_left_block_candidates_high digits against: example_second_row_candidates_high and example_first_column_candidates_high
6: [6,7,9].count(6) = 1, [6,9].count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 2 FOUND A CANDIDATE
8: [6,7,9].count(8) = 0, [6,9].count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 0
9: [6,7,9].count(9) = 1, [6,9].count(9) = 1, total_count(9) = 2 FOUND A CANDIDATE

Confirmed candidates found for cell(example_second_row, example_first_column): [6,9]


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Examples:
cell(example_second_row, example_first_column): [6,9]
[6,9].length = 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
[1].length = 1
length is 1, Passes

cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]
[2].length = 1
length is 1, Passes

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- In this step, don't print the whole Sudoku, only the rows and cells to be updated.

- Example:
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]

example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,0,1,0,0,6,4]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
The 8th position of the example_third_row is 4, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.

example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,0,1,0,0,6,4]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]
The 4th position of the example_fifth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the example_fifth_row:
example_updated_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The row to update is example_fifth_row
Using the contents of example_updated_fifth_row
example_first_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_second_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
example_fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4] (updated)
example_sixth_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- This will shift the rows to the following order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.
- Make sure to use the updated Sudoku from STEP_SIX

- Example:
example_fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]
example_sixth_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
example_first_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_second_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the rows of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
example_first_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_second_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]
example_third_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_fourth_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_sixth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
example_seventh_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_eighth_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_ninth_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

system_message:
Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells using the given information, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

prompt 1 of 7:
Respond to this message with "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. When you receive the current sudoku in <output> tags, say only "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive the last few hundred characters of the previous analysis results. When you receive the previous results say "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive instructions. When you receive the instructions, you may begin.

# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the text in the "Unbiased Results" section of my previous message. Ignore all text before that section (of my previous message) as was part of the working out (and may be cutoff at the beginning).
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells, then to update the verified ones in the Sudoku.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
    - Update and rotate the Sudoku, then output it.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the <analysis output></analysis output> tag in the '# Unbiased Results' section of my previous message. Only use the extracted results, nothing else from that message.
- If you do not see the '# Unbiased Results' header or the opening analysis output tag, that means they were cut off when the results were extracted. In that case, make sure the message ends in the closing analysis output tag and take the last six COMPLETE cells given. Make sure NOT to take a partial cell, look for each the starting word 'cell'.
- There should only be a maximum of six cells given in my previous message. If there is more than that, take ONLY a maximum of SIX cells, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the extracted text from the analysis output tag under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading or the tags from the previous message.
- When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- Find the shortest list out of the row, column, or block.
- Break up the lists into two lists each:
    - '{list_name}_low' containing all digits in the list up to 5 (the 'low' digits)
    - '{list_name}_high' containing all digits in the list from 6 upwards (the 'high' digits)
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits of the shortest set. The candidates are a subset of each of the three sets, and the shortest set gives the least digits to search.
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in each appropriate list using list.count(digit).
    - After that on the same line, sum the counts that line to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 2, immediately print "FOUND A CANDIDATE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 2 (marked by 'FOUND A CANDIDATE') and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 6 cells, cap the number to check at 6.
- The example names start with 'example_'. Yours will not.

- Example:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(example_second_row, example_first_column):

example_second_row_candidates.length = 6
example_first_column_candidates.length = 6
example_top_left_block_candidates.length = 5

shortest_list = example_top_left_block_candidates = digits to search

example_second_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6,7,9], broken into example_second_row_candidates_low = [1,2,4] and example_second_row_candidates_high = [6,7,9]
example_first_column_candidates = [1,3,4,5,6,9], broken into example_first_column_candidates_low = [1,3,4,5] and example_first_column_candidates_high = [6,9]
example_top_left_block_candidates = [2,3,6,8,9], broken into example_top_left_block_candidates_low = [2,3] and example_top_left_block_candidates_high = [6,8,9]

6: [6,7,9].count(6) = 1, [6,9].count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 2 FOUND A CANDIDATE
8: [6,7,9].count(8) = 0, [6,9].count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 0
9: [6,7,9].count(9) = 1, [6,9].count(9) = 1, total_count(9) = 2 FOUND A CANDIDATE

Confirmed candidates found for cell(example_second_row, example_first_column): [6,9]


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Examples:
cell(example_second_row, example_first_column): [6,9]
[6,9].length = 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
[1].length = 1
length is 1, Passes

cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]
[2].length = 1
length is 1, Passes

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- In this step, don't print the whole Sudoku, only the rows and cells to be updated.

- Example:
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]

example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,0,1,0,0,6,4]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
The 8th position of the example_third_row is 4, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.

example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,0,1,0,0,6,4]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]
The 4th position of the example_fifth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the example_fifth_row:
example_updated_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The row to update is example_fifth_row
Using the contents of example_updated_fifth_row
example_first_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_second_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
example_fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4] (updated)
example_sixth_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- This will shift the rows to the following order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.
- Make sure to use the updated Sudoku from STEP_SIX

- Example:
example_fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]
example_sixth_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
example_first_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_second_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the rows of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
example_first_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_second_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]
example_third_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_fourth_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_sixth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
example_seventh_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_eighth_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_ninth_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:

# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

system_message:
Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells using the given information, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

prompt 1 of 7:
Respond to this message with "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. When you receive the current sudoku in <output> tags, say only "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive the last few hundred characters of the previous analysis results. When you receive the previous results say "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive instructions. When you receive the instructions, you may begin.

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the text in the "Unbiased Results" section of my previous message. Ignore all text before that section (of my previous message) as was part of the working out (and may be cutoff at the beginning).
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells, then to update the verified ones in the Sudoku.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
    - Update and rotate the Sudoku, then output it.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the <analysis output></analysis output> tag in the '# Unbiased Results' section of my previous message. Only use the extracted results, nothing else from that message.
- If you do not see the '# Unbiased Results' header or the opening analysis output tag, that means they were cut off when the results were extracted. In that case, make sure the message ends in the closing analysis output tag and take the last six COMPLETE cells given. Make sure NOT to take a partial cell, look for each the starting word 'cell'.
- There should only be a maximum of six cells given in my previous message. If there is more than that, take ONLY a maximum of SIX cells, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the extracted text from the analysis output tag under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading or the tags from the previous message.
- When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- Find the shortest list out of the row, column, or block.
- Break up the lists into two lists each:
    - '{list_name}_low' containing all digits in the list up to 5 (the 'low' digits)
    - '{list_name}_high' containing all digits in the list from 6 upwards (the 'high' digits)
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits of the shortest set. The candidates are a subset of each of the three sets, and the shortest set gives the least digits to search.
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in each appropriate list using list.count(digit).
    - After that on the same line, sum the counts that line to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 2, immediately print "FOUND A CANDIDATE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 2 (marked by 'FOUND A CANDIDATE') and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 6 cells, cap the number to check at 6.
- The example names start with 'example_'. Yours will not.

- Example:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(example_second_row, example_first_column):

example_second_row_candidates.length = 6
example_first_column_candidates.length = 6
example_top_left_block_candidates.length = 5

shortest_list = example_top_left_block_candidates = digits to search

example_second_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6,7,9], broken into example_second_row_candidates_low = [1,2,4] and example_second_row_candidates_high = [6,7,9]
example_first_column_candidates = [1,3,4,5,6,9], broken into example_first_column_candidates_low = [1,3,4,5] and example_first_column_candidates_high = [6,9]
example_top_left_block_candidates = [2,3,6,8,9], broken into example_top_left_block_candidates_low = [2,3] and example_top_left_block_candidates_high = [6,8,9]

Checking example_top_left_block_candidates_low digits against: example_second_row_candidates_low and example_first_column_candidates_low
2: [1,2,4].count(2) = 1, [1,3,4,5].count(2) = 0, total_count(2) = 1
3: [1,2,4].count(3) = 0, [1,3,4,5].count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1

Checking example_top_left_block_candidates_high digits against: example_second_row_candidates_high and example_first_column_candidates_high
6: [6,7,9].count(6) = 1, [6,9].count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 2 FOUND A CANDIDATE
8: [6,7,9].count(8) = 0, [6,9].count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 0
9: [6,7,9].count(9) = 1, [6,9].count(9) = 1, total_count(9) = 2 FOUND A CANDIDATE

Confirmed candidates found for cell(example_second_row, example_first_column): [6,9]


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Examples:
cell(example_second_row, example_first_column): [6,9]
[6,9].length = 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
[1].length = 1
length is 1, Passes

cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]
[2].length = 1
length is 1, Passes

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- In this step, don't print the whole Sudoku, only the rows and cells to be updated.

- Example:
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]

example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,0,1,0,0,6,4]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
The 8th position of the example_third_row is 4, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.

example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,0,1,0,0,6,4]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]
The 4th position of the example_fifth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the example_fifth_row:
example_updated_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The row to update is example_fifth_row
Using the contents of example_updated_fifth_row
example_first_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_second_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
example_fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4] (updated)
example_sixth_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- This will shift the rows to the following order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.
- Make sure to use the updated Sudoku from STEP_SIX

- Example:
example_fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]
example_sixth_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
example_first_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_second_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the rows of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
example_first_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_second_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]
example_third_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_fourth_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_sixth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
example_seventh_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_eighth_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_ninth_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells using the given information, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process.

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the text in the "Unbiased Results" section of my previous message. Ignore all text before that section (of my previous message) as was part of the working out (and may be cutoff at the beginning).
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells, then to update the verified ones in the Sudoku.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
    - Update and rotate the Sudoku, then output it.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the <analysis output></analysis output> tag in the '# Unbiased Results' section of my previous message. Only use the extracted results, nothing else from that message.
- If you do not see the '# Unbiased Results' header or the opening analysis output tag, that means they were cut off when the results were extracted. In that case, make sure the message ends in the closing analysis output tag and take the last six COMPLETE cells given. Make sure NOT to take a partial cell, look for each the starting word 'cell'.
- There should only be a maximum of six cells given in my previous message. If there is more than that, take ONLY a maximum of SIX cells, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the extracted text from the analysis output tag under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading or the tags from the previous message.
- When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- Find the shortest list out of the row, column, or block.
- Break up the lists into two lists each:
    - '{list_name}_low' containing all digits in the list up to 5 (the 'low' digits)
    - '{list_name}_high' containing all digits in the list from 6 upwards (the 'high' digits)
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits of the shortest set. The candidates are a subset of each of the three sets, and the shortest set gives the least digits to search.
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in each appropriate list using list.count(digit).
    - After that on the same line, sum the counts that line to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 2, immediately print "FOUND A CANDIDATE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 2 (marked by 'FOUND A CANDIDATE') and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 6 cells, cap the number to check at 6.
- The example names start with 'example_'. Yours will not.

- Example:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(example_second_row, example_first_column):

example_second_row_candidates.length = 6
example_first_column_candidates.length = 6
example_top_left_block_candidates.length = 5

shortest_list = example_top_left_block_candidates = digits to search

example_second_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6,7,9], broken into example_second_row_candidates_low = [1,2,4] and example_second_row_candidates_high = [6,7,9]
example_first_column_candidates = [1,3,4,5,6,9], broken into example_first_column_candidates_low = [1,3,4,5] and example_first_column_candidates_high = [6,9]
example_top_left_block_candidates = [2,3,6,8,9], broken into example_top_left_block_candidates_low = [2,3] and example_top_left_block_candidates_high = [6,8,9]

Checking example_top_left_block_candidates_low digits against: example_second_row_candidates_low and example_first_column_candidates_low
2: [1,2,4].count(2) = 1, [1,3,4,5].count(2) = 0, total_count(2) = 1
3: [1,2,4].count(3) = 0, [1,3,4,5].count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1

Checking example_top_left_block_candidates_high digits against: example_second_row_candidates_high and example_first_column_candidates_high
6: [6,7,9].count(6) = 1, [6,9].count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 2 FOUND A CANDIDATE
8: [6,7,9].count(8) = 0, [6,9].count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 0
9: [6,7,9].count(9) = 1, [6,9].count(9) = 1, total_count(9) = 2 FOUND A CANDIDATE

Confirmed candidates found for cell(example_second_row, example_first_column): [6,9]


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Examples:
cell(example_second_row, example_first_column): [6,9]
[6,9].length = 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
[1].length = 1
length is 1, Passes

cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]
[2].length = 1
length is 1, Passes

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- In this step, don't print the whole Sudoku, only the rows and cells to be updated.

- Example:
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]

example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,0,1,0,0,6,4]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
The 8th position of the example_third_row is 4, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.

example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,0,1,0,0,6,4]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]
The 4th position of the example_fifth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the example_fifth_row:
example_updated_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The row to update is example_fifth_row
Using the contents of example_updated_fifth_row
example_first_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_second_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
example_fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4] (updated)
example_sixth_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- This will shift the rows to the following order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.
- Make sure to use the updated Sudoku from STEP_SIX

- Example:
example_fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]
example_sixth_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
example_first_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_second_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the rows of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
example_first_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_second_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]
example_third_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_fourth_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_sixth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
example_seventh_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_eighth_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_ninth_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

system_message:
Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells using the given information, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

prompt 1 of 7:
Respond to this message with "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. When you receive the current sudoku in <output> tags, say only "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive the last few hundred characters of the previous analysis results. When you receive the previous results say "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive instructions. When you receive the instructions, you may begin.

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the text in the "Unbiased Results" section of my previous message. Ignore all text before that section (of my previous message) as was part of the working out (and may be cutoff at the beginning).
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells, then to update the verified ones in the Sudoku.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
    - Update and rotate the Sudoku, then output it.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the <analysis output></analysis output> tag in the '# Unbiased Results' section of my previous message. Only use the extracted results, nothing else from that message.
- If you do not see the '# Unbiased Results' header or the opening analysis output tag, that means they were cut off when the results were extracted. In that case, make sure the message ends in the closing analysis output tag and take the last six COMPLETE cells given. Make sure NOT to take a partial cell, look for each the starting word 'cell'.
- There should only be a maximum of six cells given in my previous message. If there is more than that, take ONLY a maximum of SIX cells, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the extracted text from the analysis output tag under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading or the tags from the previous message.
- When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- Find the shortest list out of the row, column, or block.
- Break up the lists into two lists each:
    - '{list_name}_low' containing all digits in the list up to 5 (the 'low' digits)
    - '{list_name}_high' containing all digits in the list from 6 upwards (the 'high' digits)
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits of the shortest set. The candidates are a subset of each of the three sets, and the shortest set gives the least digits to search.
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in each appropriate list using list.count(digit).
    - After that on the same line, sum the counts that line to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 2, immediately print "FOUND A CANDIDATE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 2 (marked by 'FOUND A CANDIDATE') and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 6 cells, cap the number to check at 6.
- The example names start with 'example_'. Yours will not.

- Example:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(example_second_row, example_first_column):

example_second_row_candidates.length = 6
example_first_column_candidates.length = 6
example_top_left_block_candidates.length = 5

shortest_list = example_top_left_block_candidates = digits to search

example_second_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6,7,9], broken into example_second_row_candidates_low = [1,2,4] and example_second_row_candidates_high = [6,7,9]
example_first_column_candidates = [1,3,4,5,6,9], broken into example_first_column_candidates_low = [1,3,4,5] and example_first_column_candidates_high = [6,9]
example_top_left_block_candidates = [2,3,6,8,9], broken into example_top_left_block_candidates_low = [2,3] and example_top_left_block_candidates_high = [6,8,9]

Checking example_top_left_block_candidates_low digits against: example_second_row_candidates_low and example_first_column_candidates_low
2: [1,2,4].count(2) = 1, [1,3,4,5].count(2) = 0, total_count(2) = 1
3: [1,2,4].count(3) = 0, [1,3,4,5].count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1

Checking example_top_left_block_candidates_high digits against: example_second_row_candidates_high and example_first_column_candidates_high
6: [6,7,9].count(6) = 1, [6,9].count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 2 FOUND A CANDIDATE
8: [6,7,9].count(8) = 0, [6,9].count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 0
9: [6,7,9].count(9) = 1, [6,9].count(9) = 1, total_count(9) = 2 FOUND A CANDIDATE

Confirmed candidates found for cell(example_second_row, example_first_column): [6,9]


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Examples:
cell(example_second_row, example_first_column): [6,9]
[6,9].length = 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
[1].length = 1
length is 1, Passes

cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]
[2].length = 1
length is 1, Passes

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- In this step, don't print the whole Sudoku, only the rows and cells to be updated.

- Example:
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]

example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,0,1,0,0,6,4]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
cell(example_third_row, example_eighth_column): [1]
The 8th position of the example_third_row is 4, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.

example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,0,1,0,0,6,4]
cell(example_fifth_row, example_fourth_column): [2]
The 4th position of the example_fifth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the example_fifth_row:
example_updated_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The row to update is example_fifth_row
Using the contents of example_updated_fifth_row
example_first_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_second_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
example_fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4] (updated)
example_sixth_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- This will shift the rows to the following order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.
- Make sure to use the updated Sudoku from STEP_SIX

- Example:
example_fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]
example_sixth_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
example_first_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_second_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_third_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the rows of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
example_first_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
example_second_row: [0,0,9,2,1,0,0,6,4]
example_third_row: [8,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
example_fourth_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
example_fifth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
example_sixth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
example_seventh_row: [0,4,1,6,7,0,2,5,8]
example_eighth_row: [0,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,3]
example_ninth_row: [7,0,0,0,5,2,6,4,0]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin
