prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of six" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or six out of six)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of six" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or six out of six)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of six" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or six out of six)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of six" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or six out of six)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of six" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or six out of six)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of six" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or six out of six)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of six" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or six out of six)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of six" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or six out of six)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of six" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or six out of six)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of six" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or six out of six)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of six" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or six out of six)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]

fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:

# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of six" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or six out of six)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:

# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:

# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []

# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:

# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:

# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second_column, seventh_column, eighth_column
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (make sure to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements to use in the intersection)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
- To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.
- Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second_column, seventh_column, eighth_column
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (Use the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the correct block_missing_elements list)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
{block_name}:
[block]
{block_name}_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [{block_name}_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block:
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block:
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block:
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block:


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
- To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.
- Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
number_of_cells_to_list = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second_column, seventh_column, eighth_column
#### 1 of {number_of_cells_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (Use the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the correct block_missing_elements list)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with {current_cell_count} of 17 cells searched" (using the cell count of the current cell)
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When we have done as many unfilled cells as specified by number_of_cells_to_list, OR when you have found six cells with only one common missing element (marked with "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX") STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing {number_of_searched_cells} out of 17 cells, found {single_candidate_cells_found} out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)
If you stopped due to finding six cells with only one common missing element, also print "Stopped due to finding six cells, the maximum the output allows"

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
- To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.
- Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second_column, seventh_column, eighth_column
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (Use the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the correct block_missing_elements list)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" like this, then keep going) (The second one you find should say "FOUND TWO OF MAX SIX" instead of "FOUND ONE OF MAX SIX", and so on with correct numbers)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
- To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.
- Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second_column, seventh_column, eighth_column
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (Use the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the correct block_missing_elements list)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
- To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.
- Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeros

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled cells:
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second_column, seventh_column, eighth_column
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (Use the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the correct block_missing_elements list)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every cell in the results (up to a MAXIMUM of six), we need to list them in the following format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Note that neither of the finals sections lists the common_missing_element found in that cell. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them, but STOPPING at a maximum of six, as that's all the system can handle

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:

second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (names only)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (Use the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the correct block_missing_elements list)
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element (STEP_B), also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of six, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of six.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:

### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: common_missing_elements = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]

FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (names only)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: common_missing_elements = [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (Use the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the correct block_missing_elements list)
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of six, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of six.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: common_missing_elements = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (only list the names, not the elements)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: common_missing_elements = [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (Use the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the correct block_missing_elements list)
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of six, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of six.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: common_missing_elements = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (only list the names, not the elements)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: common_missing_elements = [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (Use the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the correct block_missing_elements list)
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of six, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of six.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: common_missing_elements = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find six out of six cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (only list the names, not the elements)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: common_missing_elements = [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (Use the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the correct block_missing_elements list)
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX SIX: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of six cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT SIX MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND SIX OF MAX SIX", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 6" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 6 out of 6)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of six

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of six, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of six.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

Awaiting instructions.

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (only list the names, not the elements)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (Use the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the correct block_missing_elements list)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):

block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],

### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (only list the names, not the elements)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (Use the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the correct block_missing_elements list)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (only list the names, not the elements)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (Use the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the correct block_missing_elements list)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (only list the names, not the elements)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (Use the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the correct block_missing_elements list)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (only list the names, not the elements)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (Use the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the correct block_missing_elements list)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (only list the names, not the elements)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (Use the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the correct block_missing_elements list)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]

FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (only list the names, not the elements)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (Use the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the correct block_missing_elements list)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 5 + 3 + 4 + 8 + 6 + 3 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 42

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 17

# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (only list the names, not the elements)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (Use the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the correct block_missing_elements list)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (only list the names, not the elements)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (only list the names, not the elements)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (only list the names, not the elements)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):

STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]

FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (only list the names, not the elements)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (only list the names, not the elements)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (only list the names, not the elements)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (only list the names, not the elements)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]

### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:

top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.

Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:

## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:

[[1,0,3],

### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:

## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements

Awaiting instructions.

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]

eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

Awaiting instructions.

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 6 + 6 + 6 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 2 = 39

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 17

# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:

### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:

### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

Awaiting instructions.

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

Awaiting instructions.

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

Awaiting instructions.

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]

ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:

second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth

total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)


### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled cell.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled cell (cells with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that cell, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
Print out the current board state using the exact format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:

### Block missing elements - Clearly listed
To avoid confusion, the block_missing_elements are listed here.

Use the following format:
top_left_block_missing_elements: {top_left_block_missing_elements list contents}
top_middle_block_missing_elements:


# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeros
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the positions as words

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled cells
total_unfilled_cells = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Cap the cells to list:
max_cells = min(total_unfilled_cells, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled cell
Go through each unfilled cell and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that cell (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both the previous result, AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled cells, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeros'.
For each unfilled cell you examine, do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A: row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B: STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that cell, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going. However if you find four out of four cells, you MUST stop searching cells)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {max_cells}
(first_row, second_column):
import first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, top_left_block_missing_elements
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2] (You MUST reference the section '### Block missing elements - Clearly listed' to get the CORRECT block_missing_elements list! The block_name listed TWO LINES BACK!!!)
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND {found_count} OF MAX FOUR: cell(first_row, second_column) (If the cell has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND {number_found} OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)", then keep going)

If you find the max of four cells to output, after printing the expected "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR: cell(row, column)" IMMEDIATELY print "STOPPING SEARCH AT FOUR MAX CELLS. Stopping with current_cell_count of max_cells cells searched"
When you print this, IMMEDIATELY stop searching

When you've done max_cells, OR when you stop due to "FOUND FOUR OF MAX FOUR", STOP listing cells and print:
"Finished printing number_of_searched_cells out of max_cells cells, found single_candidate_cells_found out of a max of 4" (using appropriate numbers, max is 17 out of 17 or 4 out of 4)

# Outputting the found cells
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled cell that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: cell(row, column)"), list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: cell(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of the ones you found, up to a max of four

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled cells with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
For every cell in the results,to a MAX of four, list them in the format:
cell(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Surround the entire list in a pair of <analysis output></analysis output> tags

Neither of the results sections should list the common_missing_elements found.

Make sure to list all cells marked with "FOUND", to a max of four.

If there were none, instead print "There are no candidate cells" inside the analysis output tags, and nothing else
